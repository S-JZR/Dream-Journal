# Description

I was standing in a clinical trial room with a group of teenagers and supervising staff to treat different fingernail health conditions. A side bench had five different unlabelled aluminium trays on top containing a shallow layer of transparent chemicals including hand sanitizer and anti-fungal solutions. The investigator explained the purpose of each tray and instructed everyone to dip their fingers into the one matching their condition. However, when it was my turn in line, I forgot the order and dipped my hands in all of them, hoping to achieve maximum cleanliness for the sake of it. The first tray caused a few flakes of white gunk to float to the surface but each one after had a diminishing effect.
