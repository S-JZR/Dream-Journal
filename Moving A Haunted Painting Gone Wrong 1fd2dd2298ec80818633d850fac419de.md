# Description

I was walking through a small art gallery room with huge rectangular portrait-oriented paintings while two staff members roamed around when I encountered an extremely haunted portrait of a woman:

- colour scheme:
    - mostly light grey-blue with a few natural colours
- style:
    - minimalist
- left:
    - mini safe with a rotating dial rested on a circular wooden stool
- middle:
    - Caucasian woman with short brown hair, a tuxedo, dark circles under her eyes, and a blank expression
- right:
    - ferns in a vase rested on a circular wooden stool
- bottom-left corner:
    - overlaid with a tiny blood stain
- background:
    - smooth wall and floor.

A female staff member moved the painting onto a wall in the back storage room and it began swinging back and forth, loudly thumping. A disembodied female voice groaned in pain and multiple small fires flickered across the original spot. The staff claimed this was a regular occurrence, claiming that the artist’s soul still resides in it from the bloodstain and desires perpetual attention.
