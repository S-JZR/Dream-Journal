# Description

I was walking through a small art gallery room where huge rectangular portrait-oriented paintings covered all walls and two staff members roamed around. An extremely haunted painting depicted a minimalistic room with a:

- Colour scheme: mostly light grey-blue with a few natural colours.
- Middle: Caucasian woman dressed in a tuxedo staring directly forward with dark circles under her eyes.
- Left: mini safe with a rotating dial rested on a circular wooden stool.
- Right: ferns in a vase rested on an identical stool.
- Bottom left corner: covered in a tiny dark blood stain.

When a staff member moved the painting onto a backroom storage wall, it began swinging back and forth, loudly thumping. A disembodied female voice groaned in pain and multiple small fires flickered across the original spot. The staff claimed this was a regular occurrence, claiming that the artist’s soul still resides in it from the bloodstain and desires perpetual attention.
