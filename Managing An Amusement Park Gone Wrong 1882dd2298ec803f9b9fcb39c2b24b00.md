# Description

I was standing outside an amusement park in a city with the ability to add and remove buildings. Satisfied with the result, I decided to stroll through the area overseeing everything I had created. Starting at the front gate, I noticed a rock band performing on a stage. The music was extremely loud, echoing throughout buildings in the city. I felt concerned that residents in neighbouring apartments might complain about the attraction, leading authorities to impose fines or restrictions. Traveling alongside the fence interior, I encountered the bizarre sight of a giant version of Tommy Pickles from Rugrats bouncing around in a diaper and ground slamming a villain. Additionally, Jimmy Neutron was swiftly climbing a tall building with an axe. Unexpectedly, my clothes transformed into an orange prison uniform and police swarmed the location searching for me.

Hiding in bushes scattered throughout the car park, I steadily trekked towards a fork in the road leading to the main street. However, instead of immediately exiting, I veered left before being arrested by a cop. Thus, I found myself time-traveling back to choose the straight route and proceeded to stroll up a steep footpath towards hundreds of spectators mesmerized by an attraction. Stopping momentarily, I turned and witnessed a monster truck in the distance, accelerating down a towering ramp, soaring into the air, and landing within the park. Atop the hill, I encountered another fork in the road and travelled to the nearest mall.

After many hours, I reached my destination and entered through the sliding doors on the second storey. Once inside, a group of teenagers began stalking me, taking turns mocking my prison uniform. In a fit of rage, I swore at them and threatened to bash their heads in. Subsequently, they fell silent, and I proceeded to an escalator that descended to the front entrance. Midway down, they resumed taunting me from the balustrade. Determined not to draw attention to myself again, I kept facing forward and ignored their remarks.
