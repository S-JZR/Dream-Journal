# Description

I was one of six casual players preparing to fight two elite players in a deathmatch inside an empty industrial square room. Everyone was equipped with machine guns.

In round one the elite members were positioned on the left and right side of the room and started by deploying smoke grenades to conceal themselves. However, as my team members provided cover fire, I advanced forward in a series of sprints and paused each time to fire bursts at the opponent on the left. My team cheered me on. The elite members were quickly eliminated.

In round two the centre of the room's left side was covered by a dividing wall made of scrap with a door on the far left. The elite members exploited the wall to quickly eliminate my other team members. I was afraid of being ambushed from both sides and forfeited.
