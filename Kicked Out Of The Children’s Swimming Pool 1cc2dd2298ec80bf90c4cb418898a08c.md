# Description

I was wearing inflatable armbands and struggling to swim in the shallow end of the pool at my primary school with various children and a male teacher supervisor sitting on a foldout chair on the other side. I was casually practicing floating on my back and front without submerging my face while two boys stood beside me.

> **Me**: Why might people think going underwater is scary?
> 

> **Boys**: Because nobody wants to experience the discomfort of breathing in water.
> 

> **Me**: Perhaps the root cause is the fear of blacking out and death.
> 

I attempted to swim laps across the entire pool by weaving between densely packed rectangular groups of children but the supervisor noticed me.

> **Man**: You are not allowed to be here!
> 

> **Man**: Move to the adult pool!
