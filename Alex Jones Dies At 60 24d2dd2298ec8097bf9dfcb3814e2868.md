# Description

I was watching the news on TV when a male anchor presented breaking news that Alex Jones had died at age 60 from a heart attack that was complicated by excessive drinking and smoking. Footage showed him talking while seated behind a curved desk on his show when he suddenly clenched his chest in pain and winced as he leaned forward.
