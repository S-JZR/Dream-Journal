# Description

I was one of many primary school students on an excursion to a western themed live crime roleplay at night. In the lobby, a female facilitator warned everyone not to be spotted otherwise it would result in an instant game over. Within a few minutes, everyone walked around a 1 storey complex outside. We overheard 3 adults in an open illuminated room discussing how they had abused a Christian man and were trying to cover it up. The students gathered around the front like it was a spectacle but the adults grew suspicious and became angry that their cover was blown. We failed and returned to the lobby to restart.
