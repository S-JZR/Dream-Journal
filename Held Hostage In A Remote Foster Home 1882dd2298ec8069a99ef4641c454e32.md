# Description

I was being held against my will in remote foster homes resembling rows of British Terrace brick houses. Determined to escape, I ventured towards the distant hill, only to stumble upon an ongoing firefight between an unidentified individual and soldiers. Seeking cover behind a rock, I eventually raised my hands in surrender as the soldiers closed in to capture me.

During the night, fires were lit in metal barrels on the hillside and children briefly emerged outside to clink metal objects and wave at the soldiers descending the hill to enforce a curfew before quickly retreating into their homes. Rushing to my door, I realized my keys were missing and urgently knocked for my caretaker, who swiftly opened the door. Realizing the run-down door lacked a lock, I pressed my back against it, determined to keep it firmly shut. I overheard my caretaker in the kitchen conversing with someone else about the behaviours and favourite hideouts of a girl who escaped.

Suddenly, one of the younger children in the home began questioning what they were saying, prompting me to gesture her to cease. Eventually, the caretaker began chanting in an unknown language, causing the front door to repeatedly creak open. For some reason, I stepped outside to pull it shut, and a patrolling soldier scolded me to return inside.
