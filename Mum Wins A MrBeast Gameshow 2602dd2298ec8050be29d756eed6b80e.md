# Description

I was one of many contestants on a Mr Beast gameshow, including my mum, competing for a $4 million prize. Everyone had to run through a long illuminated yellow cave that periodically flooded and anyone who didn’t seek shelter in areas on the sides were swept back to the start. My mum, others, and I were among the few who made the most progress. In the end, my mum won the game, and MrBeast said he would eventually wire the money to her.

I was paranoid that she might have setup the wrong details to not receive the money and wondered if she would share it with the rest of the family. I asked her later how she intended to use it and she mentioned a few things like investing some in the stock market to earn more over time. I also asked if she planned on sharing anything with us and suggested at least 50k to 100k each. I considered that after paying off my student loan debt I might have much less to spend for myself.
