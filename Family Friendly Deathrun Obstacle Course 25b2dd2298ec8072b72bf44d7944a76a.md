# Description

I was with my family attending an outdoor family obstacle course with a concrete path that led through a series of obstacles.

During the first obstacle we walked down a path and I noticed a red lazer tripwire between two cylindrical posts on the floor. I tried warning my family not to touch it but my dad nearly triggered it by stepping over it and my brother triggered it by passing through. Glass walls lifted to trap my brother in a small rectangular area as two white robot arms holding rubber knives were lowered inside. They randomly moved around and alternated between spinning and stabbing motions. My brother ran into the corner to hide but eventually got hit in the side of his torso.

In the second obstacle we encountered a narrow path suspended over a deep rectangular hole with two large industrial fans on the left blowing intense gusts of wind that could push anyone off into the hole. I got down low and crawled across the ground while pushing strongly left against the wind to stay on course.

In obstacle three I encountered a woman inside a rectangular cave filled with snow blocks that was rumoured to be infinite. She tried to find an exit by randomly mining patches and became afraid that she would be trapped forever. My brother mentioned that the area was only about 6 metres tall so I told her to help me dig upwards as we quickly surfaced to see:

- Left: wooden two-rail fence and a large tree.
- Front: distant snowy neighbourhood.
- Ground: snow everywhere.

While hopping over the fence to approach the tree my parents yelled at me to stop as hundreds of Mistletoebird were flying around its branches, looking for a place to migrate and could attack me. Eventually, they flew away into the previous snow cave.

My family entered a room in a nearby hotel at the complex to stay for the night. I noticed a pill bottle on drawers belonging to someone else. A male teenager walked past the front door and I asked him about it. He said it might belong to his father and that he would check. I explicitly told him to confirm if it was the exact bottle which made my family chuckle since it was already implied. I also found some white powder in a blue tray and dumped it into the bin outside the hallway.
