# Description

I was walking through my unit when invisible demons tormented me by sneaking up from behind and hiding different objects. Discovering a Bible, I rebuked them in the name of Jesus Christ, prompting every object to materialize as various clouds of mist swiftly rushed to swing open the front and back door, leaving them unlocked.
