# Description

I was standing with various people scattered throughout a bank when a UFO bored a hole in the ceiling with a wide flexible black tube which stayed outside. Everyone instinctively knew they had to remain still otherwise they would be abducted. One person moved slightly and was rapidly sucked up the tube as their flesh transformed into green goo and they yelled silently while shaking their head side to side.
