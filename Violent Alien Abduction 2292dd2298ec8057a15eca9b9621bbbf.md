# Description

I was standing in a bank with various people scattered around when a UFO hovered above the roof and bored a hole through the ceiling to lower a wide flexible black tube inside. Everyone instinctively knew they had to remain still otherwise they would be abducted. One person moved slightly and was rapidly sucked up the tube as their flesh transformed into green goo and they yelled silently while shaking their head side to side.
