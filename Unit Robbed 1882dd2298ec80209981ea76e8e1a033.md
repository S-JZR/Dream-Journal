# Description

I was returning to my unit with my family at night when we noticed that someone had broken in as the front door was left wide open and the interior lights were on.

> **Dad**: Wait here for a moment while I investigate.
> 

I only saw my dad enter the unit but I instinctively knew he wouldn't find anything and the criminals were already long gone.
