# Description

I was standing outside my unit complex, boarding a small white school bus full of mostly female students heading to music class. The bus driver got lost, drove into the city, looped back to my house, and turned down a fictional dirt path near the park to pass a horse carriage moving the opposite direction.

Upon arriving at music class, each student was given a hearing test by the female teacher using one small vibrating ring clipped to their ear. Afterwards, everyone moved to the same room to learn music theory. I felt annoyed and later told the teacher that I didn’t think it was relevant to my future career so she asked why I didn't say something earlier and wasted years learning it.

Everyone entered a small room for an exam, sat around multiple white fold-out tables put together, and received a green and red button. The teacher quizzed us on the theory including what are semaphores but almost nobody could remember anything and I felt bad. The teacher assumed we were being shy but I knew it was because we genuinely didn’t know the answers.
