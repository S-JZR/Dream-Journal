# Description

I was one of many people trapped in a shopping mall during a zombie outbreak and all entrances were sealed with rolling corrugated metal doors. Food was running low and everyone was starting to get worried. A slightly open metal door at one entrance revealed a skybridge where an infected man, wearing only underwear, lay on his side, facing the opposite direction, subtly jolted uncontrollably, with scratches and a rash covering his back. A woman’s pale face peered through the bent section on the left side of the door. I stuck a pencil on her lip, prompting her to react as I pulled it away, leaving a small flake of her skin on the tip.

After returning to a shop with a woman, I handed her the pencil, but she carelessly placed the tip in her mouth. I reprimanded her, warning that she could get infected and feared she might turn into a zombie later.

I encountered one long and two short washing machines stacked vertically. Someone asked if I wanted food and I agreed. They told me to place a cotton sheet I had onto a plate in the top machine. All the machines started automatically, tearing the cotton into pieces, and distributing them to the lower machines. Peas and corn were dispensed onto the plate. I was annoyed about losing the sheet.
