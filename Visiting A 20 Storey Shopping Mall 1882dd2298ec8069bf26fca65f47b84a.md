# Description

During the weekend, my family carpooled with another family to visit a new 20-story shopping mall. With hardly anyone around, we effortlessly found a parking spot. In the vestibule, we encountered a middle-aged security guard in a black uniform standing beside two thick sliding steel doors. When asked to enter he gladly opened the doors, revealing a desolate landscape with most stores closed.

We feared the trip was wasted but found an illuminated discount store on the opposite side of the mall. Returning to the entrance, we saw the guard talk and exchange money with someone who exclaimed, "Now I can finally buy more cartridges!" After speaking with the guard, the power unexpectedly cut out. He opened the doors in a defensive stance, but nothing occurred, so he escorted us back to our car.
