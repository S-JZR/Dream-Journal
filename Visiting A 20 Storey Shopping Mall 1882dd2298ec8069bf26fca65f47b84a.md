# Description

I was seated in my mum's car, carpooling with my family and another family, and being driven by my mum during the weekend to visit a new 20-story shopping mall. With hardly anyone around, we effortlessly found a parking spot. In the vestibule, we encountered a male middle-aged security guard in a black uniform standing beside two thick sliding steel doors.

> **Me**: Can we go through?
> 

> **Guard**: Certainly.
> 

He gladly opened the doors, revealing a desolate landscape with most stores closed. We feared the trip was wasted but found an illuminated discount store on the opposite side of the mall. Returning to the entrance, we saw the guard talk and exchange money with a man.

> **Man**: Now I can finally buy more cartridges!
> 

After we talked with the guard, the power unexpectedly cut out. He opened the doors in a firing stance holding his pistol, but nothing occurred, so he escorted us back to our car.
