# Description

On one occasion, I was semi-consciously sleep talking with mumbled cries as my eyes were still open, yet I was aware of the phenomenon in third-person as if I were another entity inside my body observing its responses.

Overhearing the commotion, my mother tapped my shoulder, reassuring me that everything was alright and that I was merely dreaming, without waking me up, as I pondered why my body was mumbling independently.
