# Description

I was half-asleep with my eyes open when I began mumbling cries. I felt confused because I was aware of my body seemingly acting independently and I could still think clearly as I wondered what it was doing. My mum overhead the commotion and tapped my shoulder without waking me up to reassure me that everything was alright and I was merely dreaming but I knew that I was still awake. She didn’t know my eyes were open because it was dark.

# Pre Dream

- For an entire month, I went through a phase of occasionally panicking in my sleep for no apparent reason and I don’t know why.

# Post Dream

- After the strange experience which unsettled me a bit, I started to consider whether we actually have a soul and a body that can operate independently.
