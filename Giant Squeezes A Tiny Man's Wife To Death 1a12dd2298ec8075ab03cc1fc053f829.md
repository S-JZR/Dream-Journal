# Description

A tiny couple stood on a small wooden desk when a giant approached and reached out to grasp the woman in his horizontal fist. The man shouted at the giant to stop and desperately tried prying open the massive fingers. However, the giant coldly replied that it was impossible for him to save her now and tightened his grip until squeezing her to death as the man mourned helplessly over the fist.
