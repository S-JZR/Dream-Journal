# Description

I was following a boy and girl holding helium balloons across an elevated strip of grassy ground:

- left:
    - short cream brick wall with a black fence on top
    - abandoned public bathroom with holes in the walls and white tiles on the floor
- front:
    - power pole
- right:
    - three spaced pine trees
    - looping road within a large grassy area
    - building with various people having a party.

As the children walked beside the power pole, one of their balloons touched a low hanging wire and burst. Electricity arced through the air into their bodies and they fell down motionless. Another balloon was about to the touch the wires so I fled backwards to avoid being harmed as the same thing happened.

I repeatedly waved my arms to try getting the attention of people at the party and moved forward past the trees to be more visible but nobody noticed. Three distant women in front of me approached to investigate.

> **Woman**: What seems to be the …
> 

> **Me**: Call an ambulance, they’ve been electrocuted!
> 

One of the women crouched beside the girl to check her pulse.

> **Woman**: She’s breathing strangely.
> 

The women pulled the children away from the power poles to keep them safe. While we waited for an ambulance, we walked through the abandoned bathroom.

> **Woman**: Can you explain what happened?
> 

> **Me**: The balloons contained helium so when touching the wires they combusted and the fire excited ions that allowed the electricity to arc across the air into their bodies.
> 

The woman was surprised, not expecting a scientific answer, but acknowledged it.

I walked backwards and teleported upstairs in a house. I saw powerline wires travelling through the kid’s rooms, connected to wire coils on the ceiling, and continuing downstairs. I considered how dangerous these exposed wires were and considered painting a yellow outline on the coils to alert others of their presence.
