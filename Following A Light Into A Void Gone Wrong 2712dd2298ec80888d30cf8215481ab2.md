# Description

I was one of many passengers seated in a train carriage with a red interior and black carpet when we were captivated by a supernatural flashing light above distant mountains that illuminated the entire sky. I pulled out a thick polaroid camera and tried looking through the view finder but I could barely see anything because I couldn’t get my eye close enough for some reason.

Everyone stayed aboard to keep watching the strange phenomenon. The train transformed into a commercial airliner flying through a narrow shallow valley. The pilot was growing weary from being blinded by the light each time it came into view over the valley. A female co-pilot entered from behind and noticed his condition.

> **Woman**: Would you like me to take over?
> 

> **Man 1**: No thanks, I'm quite alright.
> 

Everyone was teleported into an alternative dimension featuring a white void and we decided to stay there for as long as possible to see what would happen next. However, a week passed without anyone noticing and while lying on the floor I fell into a psychosis where I drifted in and out of consciousness and had a vision of how things truly were. The floor was covered in pink goo and I spectated myself standing silently with an exhausted sorrowful expression, a slightly open mouth, staring back. Goo started dripping from their mouth and they melted into the floor. A disembodied male voice spoke to me.

> **Man 2**: Is it necessary to stay here?
> 

> **Me**: No.
> 

> **Man 2**: Run kid!
> 

> **Man 2**: You already have one foot in the fire!
> 

I was overcome with dread and sprinted away into the distance.

> **Crowd**: Wait!
> 

> **Crowd**: Don’t leave yet!
> 

I ignored them and crossed a boundary that teleported me back to the real world.
