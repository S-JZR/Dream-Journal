# Description

I was one of many passengers seated in a train carriage with a red interior and black carpet when we were captivated by a supernatural flashing light above distant mountains that illuminated the entire sky. I pulled out a thick polaroid camera and tried looking through the view finder but I could barely see anything because I couldn’t get my eye close enough for some reason.

Everyone stayed aboard to keep watching the strange phenomenon. The train transformed into a commercial airliner flying through a narrow shallow valley. The pilot was growing weary from being blinded by the light each time it came into view over the valley. Another female pilot offered to takeover but he insisted he was alright.

Everyone was teleported into an alternative dimension featuring a white void and we decided to stay there for as long as possible to see what would happen next. However, a week passed without anyone noticing and while lying on the floor I fell into a psychosis where I drifted in and out of consciousness and had a vision of how things truly were. The floor was covered in pink goo and I saw myself standing silently with a sorrowful expression as it dripped from my open mouth before I melted into the floor. A disembodied male voice spoke to me.

> **Man**: Is it necessary to stay here?
**Me**: No.
**Man**: Run kid! You already have one foot in the fire!
> 

I was overcome with dread and sprinted away into the distance.

> **Crowd**: Wait! Don’t leave yet!
> 

I ignored them and crossed a boundary that teleported me back to the real world.
