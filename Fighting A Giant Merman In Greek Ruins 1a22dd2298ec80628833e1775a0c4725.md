# Description

I played as a Greek warrior in a PS1-style game set in a square grassy landscape featuring:

- Left:
    - Dirt path running across the entire left side with a central fork leading to the bridge.
- Centre:
    - Grey brick bridge crossing a moat to a small island.
    - Tall tower, resembling the Tower of Pisa, with floors without interiors, stairs, and a waterfall on the top flowing down onto the ground and into the moat.
- Everywhere:
    - Scattered boulders, vegetations, and crumbling Greek pillars.
- Perimeter:
    - Tall mountains.

Upon approaching the tower, a hostile giant merman, four-storeys tall with a cyan body and dark green scaly legs, emerged from the door, wielding a trident as he slowly trudged down the pathway, driven by a primitive AI with poor detection and responsiveness to nearby players.

I attempted to slash their ankles with my sword, but despite my character barely moving inside their moving foot, the hitbox registered damage as if I were being stood on, killing me as I jumped into the air to land on my back. After respawning, I played more methodically, slashing from behind to provoke the giant to follow before ascending the tower stairs to the top level. However, the giant climbed to the top level and sat down, exhausted from dehydration, filling a cup from the waterfall to drink, providing an opportunity to attack.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I stayed up late playing old GameMaker Sandbox games like Battleship Forever and lji.
- I’ve been wanting to play Mythology for a while which probably influenced the Greek mythology theme.
