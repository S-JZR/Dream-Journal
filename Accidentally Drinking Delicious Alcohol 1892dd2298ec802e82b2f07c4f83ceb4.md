# Description

I was standing in the kitchen of my unit when I noticed a tall rectangular glass bottle with a diamond-shaped lid on the counter and began drinking a few shots using the lid. It tasted fantastic, with no hint of it being an alcoholic beverage, so I continued taking sips.

> **Mum**: Stop it's alcoholic!

I checked the back label and saw the alcohol concentration was 50%, prompting me to stop to avoid becoming extremely drunk.
