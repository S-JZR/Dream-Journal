# Description

I was floating in a a small central circular wave pool in a water theme park with my family and a fictional younger brother.

Eventually, the child entered a separate building where people were already seated at a row of customer service counters with glass shields and seating on both sides. He took a seat as a staff member discussed aspects of a strategy game involving graph theory, but when he questioned part of the diagram, he was scolded for being naïve. After the unexpected incident, he returned to me as we were both shaken, so I told him not to let one bad moment ruin the day just because someone else wasn't behaving well.

While driving around an underground car park in another location looking for a vacant spot, I let the child take control of the wheel. However, he was getting too close to pillars and cars so I told him “You don't have a driver's licence, so it's a bad idea for you to drive here,” and we swapped places.
