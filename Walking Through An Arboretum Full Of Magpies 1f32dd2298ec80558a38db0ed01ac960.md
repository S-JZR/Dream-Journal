# Description

I was walking at night through a circular illuminated arboretum enclosed by a brick wall with evenly spaced evergreen trees. Hundreds of magpies were scattered across the ground among loose branches. As I nervously crept down a central cobblestone path to the other side, the magpies began to hop and fly away. I felt anxious, anticipating that a swarm would attack, but nothing occurred.
