# Description

A child and I were attending an occult meeting wearing black hooded robes with golden halos. We emerged from a pine forest surrounding a meadow to approach the front of an elevated small grey castle. While passing a group of 10 disgruntled people standing about 75 meters from the castle, we formed the outline of a triangle above our heads, feeling elitist for belonging to something they did not. Suddenly, one individual annoyed by our gaze, rhetorically questioned what we were looking at, and everyone simultaneously began chasing us with ill-intentions. As we dashed onto the concrete walkway at the front door, the child used a microphone on a stand plugged into the wall to warn the guards of a full-scale attack. Snipers on the balcony above began firing shots down at the fleeing attackers who were all killed. However, the castle went into lockdown, with distant members hiding behind circular hay bales scattered around the area while the guards prepared to fire on anyone, including their own members.

As we passed through the castle with a modern interior featuring dark grey carpet tiles, we noticed another member through a window sitting outside on the stone stairs concealed by a concrete wall with a brick removed every three steps. After opening the side wooden door, he called over to us, asking when the lockdown will end, as he was hesitant to move with a sniper in the distant bushes. To halt the procedure, I instructed the child to use the microphone outside again to clarify that their wording was exaggerated and everything was safe. For some reason upon exiting, he became overly devotional towards a statue, falling to his knees and outstretching his arms to the sky and then to his sides while speaking to it in a slightly exposed area below the balcony. A red sniper dot wandered unsteadily over his shoulder, trying to determine if he was a threat before moving away to fire a warning shot, barely missing him as he hurried backwards into concealment.
