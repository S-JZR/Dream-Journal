# Description

I was seated in my mum's car with my family being driven by my mum to a church service in the city during Christmas time. After parking beside the sidewalk, we descended a courtyard staircase with wide steps. To the right was a narrow alleyway with various restaurants built into the wall, followed by the church at the end.

As everyone sauntered into the church, I locked eyes with a white mannequin at the entrance, which nervously turned its head away in one swift motion. Attempting to catch it in the act again, I crept out from the entryway and saw its right eye peering from the side of its head, checking to see if I was still there.

Feeling unsettled, I awkwardly trudged into the church amphitheatre to the furthest aisle on the left, unaware that those seeking deliverance were asked to approach the stage. As the aisles filled, I didn't want to disturb the line by cutting through, so I joined it, seeing no downside.

A female preacher descended from the stage with a microphone, approaching everyone individually. Everyone had a correct interpretation except me.

> **Preacher**: After you receive a divine interpretation respond with correct or incorrect.
> 

> **Preacher**: You were born in the United Kingdom.
> 

> **Me**: *cringe* Actually I was born in Australia.
> 

> **Preacher**: You act like you’ve seen a ghost.
> 

> **Me**: Yes I have.
> 

> **Audience**: *laughter*
> 

> **Preacher**: Where did you see it and what did it look like?
> 

> **Me**: [Recalls the experience].
> 

> **Preacher**: That mannequin outside?
> 

> **Preacher**: It’s just an animatronic part of the Christmas display.
> 

After the service, I examined it, confirming that it cycled through a range of head motions, and I overlooked a Santa Claus animatronic pressed against the wall behind it.
