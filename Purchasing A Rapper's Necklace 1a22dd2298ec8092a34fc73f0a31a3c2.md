# Description

I was standing at the drop-off zone of my primary school with the fences removed during an era around the 1980s when a group of kids sat on the left side of the seating area on a strip of yellowing cut grass, watching passing cars. I drove a miniature light-green tractor towards them.

> **Black Student**: Stop riding that tractor!
> 

> **Black Student**: It reminds me of my ancestors who were forced to work on plantations!
**Me**: I’m sorry.
> 

I turned to drive away.

> **Black Student**: Why are you still driving it when I just told you how I feel about it!
> 

Suddenly, I was friends with a fictional aspiring black rapper called Syske, renowned for wearing a gold chain with an enormous rectangular prism pendant engraved with intricate patterns.

> **Me**: Hey Syske I really want your old gold necklace and I was wondering if I could buy it.
> 

> **Syske**: Find I’ll let you have it but with a discount.
> 

After purchasing the necklace a student holding a smaller silver one noticed it and another friend approached me.

> **Student**: Do you want to trade with my father?
> 

> **Friend**: (Whisper) This sounds like a bad idea and his only weighs a fraction of yours.
> 

> **Me**: (Whisper) Don't worry its fine.
> 

> **Me**: Sure.
> 

> **Student**: Follow me.
> 

I followed him along the footpath outside the drop-off zone cobblestone wall and encountered his father in a black car starting to enter the school while talking on his phone.

> **Student**: Dad I found someone who is willing to trade their necklace.
> 

His dad frantically pulled out various American bills ranging from $1 to $500 and gave all he had to me and I handed over my necklace. I continued walking further down the street when I encountered a fictional male bully standing beside a magazine stand.

> **Bully**: Hey! How much is that necklace worth and where did it come from?
> 

> **Me**: It's worth around $2,000 and belongs to Syske.
> 

I pointed to Syske on a magazine cover.

> **Bully**: Pfft! I've never heard of him so he must only be popular locally.
> 

> **Me**: Just wait until he becomes an icon and his jewellery grows in value, then you'll see!
