# Description

I was at the drop-off zone of my primary school with the fence removed during an era around the 1980s when a group of kids sat on the left side of the seating area on a strip of yellowing cut grass, watching passing cars. While riding a miniature light-green tractor towards them, a black student expressed annoyance, explaining it reminded him of his ancestors forced to work on plantations and told me to stop riding it. After apologizing, I turned to drive away but he remained infuriated that I continued despite acknowledging his concerns.

Suddenly, I was friends with a fictional aspiring black rapper called Syske, renowned for wearing a gold chain with an enormous rectangular prism pendant engraved with intricate patterns. After bargaining with him, he let me purchase his previous one at a discounted price. Another student at the drop-off zone, holding a smaller silver one, noticed it and asked if I could collaborate with his father to trade.

While agreeing and travelling along the drop-off zone cobblestone wall, another fictional friend tried convincing me it was a bad idea as his weighed a fraction of mine. Eventually, we spotted his father in a black car driving into the school on his phone when the boy interrupted him. After explaining the offer, he frantically pulled out various American bills with values ranging from 1 to 500 dollars and gave all he had for it. Feeling generous, I gave back some miscellaneous Australian notes from my pocket and continued along the street. Suddenly, a brash kid appeared to ask how much the necklace was worth and where it came from. I explained it was worth around $2,000 and pointed to Syske on a magazine cover. He scoffed, claiming he never heard of him, so he must only be popular locally within Brisbane. I responded to wait until he becomes an icon when the jewellery grows exponentially in value.
