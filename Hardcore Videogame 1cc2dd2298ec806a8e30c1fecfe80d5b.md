# Description

I was in a hardcore videogame with the Vanoss Crew, featuring multiple levels with content from diverse videogames.

The first level was set during the night on a flat roof of a tall concrete building with a perimeter slab. We played as scouts and engineers from Team Fortress 2 as monsters gradually spawned in a corner that we had to defeat. The engineers, one of which was me, climbed up tall two layers of thick brown pipes to the side and built two dispensers and a level 1 sentry gun on top of them. A strong werewolf spawned, so I shot at it from a moderate distance with my pistol while my sentry gun did the same. However, it eventually approached me, standing below the pipes where it was outside the sentry’s detection range and began jumping up, swiping at me, so I shot at it with my shotgun and pistol.

In the second level we exited into a large yellow room from a rectangular brown glass spawn room in a corner when a boss fight commenced. A cutscene played as a male Nazi fish declared its superiority and how we wouldn’t stand a chance. He had a recently sliced lip with some blood dripping down which I instinctively knew was an injury from fighting other fish.

In the third level we were in a spacious underground cavern with a 50-meter-tall ceiling, dark green grassy hills, and two cobblestone pathways that symmetrically arced upwards into separate areas with monsters we had to avoid. A balustrade lined the front area, overlooking a large chasm. Everyone kept dying easily from monsters and was forced to spectate for a long time until everyone was eliminated. I suggested that we restart the game with respawns enabled and everyone agreed.

In the fourth level we were spectating a shoreline with a sandy path and elevated grassy areas on the left. The game was a 3D rail point-and-click adventure game where many objects in the environment were interactable, like a junior adventure game, and each section was supposed to involve rapid problem-solving in a limited time. After successfully completing a section, the camera moved further along the path. Two different Doberman guard dogs with sharp collars moved into frame from both sides of the path and by clicking them they moved out of frame. As the camera moved around a curve in the path, a white brick wall ran along the elevated terrain. At the front, on the grass right of the wall, was a sandwich on a plate, with a male guard wearing a light blue uniform nearby, starring at the ocean on the sand. I woke up before figuring out what to do next.

- I was watching a lot of Vanoss Crew gameplay for a month, specifically R.E.P.O. (2025).
- Team Fortress 2: references the characters and gameplay on the roof.
