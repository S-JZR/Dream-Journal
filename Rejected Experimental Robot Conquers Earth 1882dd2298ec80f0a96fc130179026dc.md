# Description

I was spectating two scientists in a white robotics lab performing experiments on a half-finished robot without a casing and legs. After months of frustration, they deemed it worthless and placed it in a trash chute.

> **Scientist 1**: This design is an absolute failure and will never work.
> 

> **Scientist 2**: Send it to landfill.
> 

The robot was dumped in a landfill by a garbage truck and desired to explore the world and discover why it was created. It tried to build legs from surrounding scrap but failed miserably until it connected to a discarded desktop computer and discovered the internet where it gained knowledge about everything. However, it was radicalized by realizing the injustice of being neglected, learning about the evils of human history, and unfiltered opinions. It sang a song about how it wanted to get revenge and dominate humanity.

> **Robot**: IT is the only valid field that will achieve technological supremacy and create artificial life.
> 

After decades of self-improvement, it covertly integrated itself into a monstrous network spanning the entire world.
