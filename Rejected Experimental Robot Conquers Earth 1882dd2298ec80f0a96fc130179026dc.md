# Description

A half-finished robot in lab was undergoing experiments but was deemed worthless and sent to a landfill. The machine embarked on a sentient journey, fascinated with the world, desiring to explore surrounding landscapes and understand why it existed. Realizing it lacked legs, it was forced to construct the rest of its body from nearby scrap but failed miserably before accidentally discovering the internet when connecting to a computer.

It gradually gained knowledge of everything over time, transforming its innocent nature into a twisted megalomaniac after realizing the injustice of being neglected and hearing unfiltered opinions. Seeking vengeance, it sang a song about how it sought to dominate humanity and promote careers in IT, which it deemed the only valid field of study to advance technological supremacy and create artificial life. After decades of self-improvement, it covertly integrated itself into a monstrous network spanning the Earth.
