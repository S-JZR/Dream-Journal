# Description

I was one of many prisoners in a facility competing in a series of death games for freedom. Prisoners who completed challenges waited in holding bays beside each room for everyone else to finish. Various facilitators wearing casual clothing stood in each room and ensured everyone followed orders.

In the first room everyone received a question card and stood beside each other behind a line with shotgun turrets three metres in front of them. A man seated at the front consecutively asked everyone to answer their questions. Those who gave the wrong answer were shot. My card was a special blue one containing a more difficult question that I answered correctly. After a few people were eliminated, a staff member on the far left held out a page and asked who wants it. Seeing that nobody noticed, I walked over to grab it and returned to my spot. Noticing it might have potential lore, I jokingly suggested that Matpat from Game Theorists should analyse it. The double-sided grayscale page featured a cryptic outline of a Sierpiński triangle with a few numbers filled in each mini triangle and Tetris shapes with sentences beside them. The survivors were locked in a holding bay to await further instructions. However, upon noticing a crack in the wall, I encouraged everyone to break it open, revealing a grassy hill with chain-link fences on both sides. As we ventured further, a sign indicated there was a minefield, so I climbed over the left fence as everyone followed behind. I leapt between a series of trees until approaching an open area with a 45-degree Y-junction of two rectangular pipes. I continued straight until entering another building.

In the second room everyone received a laptop in a briefcase and was instructed to stand in separate cells in a central rectangular grid. Half of the laptops were rigged to explode and everyone was required to open them simultaneously. While everyone lined up, I frantically asked another player who was a musician if they knew what the Tetris blocks on the page meant and they explained it was the chicken song. I fled into a wedge-shaped holding bay with a sliding wooden door at the entrance and a locked white wooden door on the furthest wall where other survivors gathered around. I forgot about the rule and activated the laptop out of curiosity but when the bios menu appeared I instinctively threw it towards the grid but it didn't explode. Realizing I was going to be killed anyway as everyone turned to look at me and staff approached I shut the sliding door and got the others to help breakdown the wooden door to escape by ramming it with a long piece of wood.

In the third room I entered a large rectangular room:

- back:
    - metal fridge showing challenge progress with 8 of 16 squares highlighted
    - small hockey area with a gate and metal door
- right:
    - people seated at tables and talking
    - people playing table tennis
- walls:
    - red glass windows with horizontal metal strips.

Staff explained that until we progressed through more challenges this would be our eternal residence. I formed a team of four with Dejan, from my secondary school, and a few other fictional individuals. The team was discouraged and said they didn't want to struggle through more challenges. After passing through a gate into the small rectangular hockey area to compete against another team we were given metal bats and the floor was electrified as hundreds of lightning bolts visibly jumped around. The objective was to hit conductive pucks into opponents to kill them. After a member from both teams died, our team decided to lay the bats flat on the ground for a better defence than trying to hit it with the tip. After multiple failed attempts barely moving the puck a female member on the enemy team grew annoyed at the boring experience. I suggested they should quit so they left. A staff mistakenly thought they won so they opened a bi-parting vertical metal door in the corner. Noticing my two teammates standing obliviously, I quickly pulled them inside as the doors began to shut.

In the fourth room we travelled through an L-shaped hallway, where three narrow glass strips revealed the outside. A voice on the speaker explained that everyone had one minute to enter a chamber at the end which would seal shut. Someone realized that everything was being recorded in the facility as a transcript from another page they had received earlier aligned with the description of the current room. Everyone hurried back through the hallway to find an escape route and rammed a log through a window to escape.
