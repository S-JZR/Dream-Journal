# Description

While inside a complex with various rooms, I followed a diverse crowd into a large amphitheatre without seats, navigating around a spiral of chain-linked fences gradually descending around a central elevated circular stage featuring a 1960s era television broadcasting a male charismatic tyrannical leader. I don’t recall the exact message, but I sensed a tone of progressive posthumanism, conveying the idea that everyone is oppressed and advocating for a new era of rational science to bring about equality, restore power to the people, and guiding evolution according to our desires.

Everyone listened intently to his words, but when attempting to discredit the speech by conversing with Brooke, a student who used to read science textbooks during religious education in primary school, she dismissed my words as foolishness.

Exiting into the hallway, I encountered a chapel service in a small rectangular room on the left singing hymns. Suddenly, Satan appeared in the complex, adamantly trying to capture me. I fled inside but he patiently waited so I began singing until after a long time he gave up and wandered away.
