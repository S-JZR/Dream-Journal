# Description

I was standing inside a complex with a crowd walking in a line through a spiral of chain-linked fences around a circular amphitheatre without seats, descending a continuously slanted floor that descended multiple levels. A central circular stage at the bottom featured a 1960s era television broadcasting a male charismatic dictator passionately yelling a message.

> **Dictator**: Humanity has long been oppressed by systems of power.
**Dictator**: We’re kept ignorant by primitive traditions that hinder scientific advancements, narrow beliefs about our nature, sexuality, and gender that confine our potential and autonomy, and petty social constructs creating arbitrary distinctions that lead us to other and slaughter one another.
**Dictator**: God doesn't consider us good and evolved enough to make our own decisions and withheld knowledge from us, divided us from uniting as one, and imprisoned us in bodies designed to make us weak, stupid, subservient, and doomed to perpetual suffering.
**Dictator**: It’s time to embrace a new era guided by reason, science, and collective will to restore equality, power over our own destinies, and guide evolution to achieve our own salvation.
> 

Everyone listened intently to his words and I tried to jokingly discredit him to Brooke beside me, a student who read science textbooks during religious education classes in primary school.

> **Me**: (To Brooke): Can you believe this guy?
**Brooke**: Stop being ridiculous.
> 

After fleeing into the hallway, I encountered Satan, a muscular red horned creature emitting a deep vibration, approaching to capture me for rebelling. I hid in a small chapel to the left where I slammed the double doors shut and began singing hymns to God. Satan patiently stood in front of the door for hours until he eventually gave up and left.
