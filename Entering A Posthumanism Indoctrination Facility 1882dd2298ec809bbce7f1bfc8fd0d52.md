# Description

I was standing inside a complex with a crowd walking in a line through a spiral of chain-linked fences around a circular amphitheatre without seats, descending a continuously slanted floor that descended multiple levels. A central circular stage at the bottom featured a 1960s era television broadcasting a male charismatic dictator passionately yelling a message.

> **Dictator**: Humanity has long been oppressed by systems of power.
**Dictator**: We’re kept ignorant by primitive traditions that hinder scientific advancements, narrow beliefs about our nature, sexuality, and gender that confine our potential and autonomy, and petty social constructs creating arbitrary distinctions that lead us to other and slaughter one another.
**Dictator**: God doesn't consider us good and evolved enough to make our own decisions and withheld knowledge from us, divided us from uniting as one, and imprisoned us in bodies designed to make us weak, stupid, subservient, and doomed to perpetual suffering.
**Dictator**: It’s time to embrace a new era guided by reason, science, and collective will to restore equality, power over our own destinies, and guide evolution to achieve our own salvation.
> 

Everyone listened intently to his words and I tried to jokingly discredit him to Brooke beside me, a student who read science textbooks during religious education classes in primary school.

> **Me**: Can you believe this guy?
**Brooke**: Stop being ridiculous.
> 

After fleeing into the hallway, I encountered Satan, a muscular red horned creature emitting a deep vibration, approaching to capture me for rebelling. I hid in a small chapel to the left where I slammed the double doors shut and began singing hymns to God. Satan patiently stood in front of the door for hours until he eventually gave up and left.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - During religious education I saw Brooke sitting at the row of computer desks to the left of the classroom studying science textbooks because she was probably an atheist.
    - I’ve heard people claim Lucifer as a hero who rebelled against the perceived totalitarian rule of God who withheld knowledge and our true potential, and that we should question authority, be self-worshipers, and embrace complete autonomy.
    - I’ve heard people claim religion and traditions are outdated, oppressive, and hold us back from utopia and scientific progress so we should embrace a new era of science, reason, philosophy, progressivism, and humanism.
    - I see a lot of hatred in some people who push progressive ideologies.
- Personal Thoughts:
    - I’ve wrestled and been afraid for a long time about:
        - Technology:
            - People playing god via technology.
            - People trying to create a new race of people.
            - Replacing the image of God via technology.
            - People trying to create a robot god to manage society.
            - Everyone rejecting the consequences of sin via technology.
            - Information monopolies normalizing sin.
        - Identity:
            - The stupidity of racism, war, and division, and considering a transcendent identity.
        - Religion:
            - Were humans made weak by God?
            - Is God trustworthy?
        - Politics:
            - The fear of an evil figure manipulating humanity’s desire for freedom, equality and lusts to promote a personal agenda.
- Christianity:
    - Reminds me of Romans 12:2, John 15:18–19, Ephesians 6:12, Matthew 7:13-14, and James 4:7.
    - References the Tower of Babel.

## Symbols

- Amphitheatre:
    - Upside down Tower of Babel.
    - The world.
- Fences:
    - False freedom, security, and enlightenment.
    - Descending further into deception and corruption.
- Brooke:
    - The fear of being blinded by society and pride.
    - I don't think science itself is bad.
- 1960’s TV:
    - The start of the sexual revolution.
- Dictator:
    - Rebelliousness and hatred against God, his followers, and the natural order.
    - The desire to be like god.

## Lessons

- Don't be conformed to the pattern of this world.
- Submit to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

# Notes

- I don't remember the exact dialogue and this is a recreation.
