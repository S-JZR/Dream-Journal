# Description

I was standing in the lounge room of my unit when I assumed for my entire life in the dream that I had five fingers and toes. However, I decided to count them and realized I had eight fingers and toes. I struggled to believe it and recounted them twice with the same result. I had full control over my fingers and was able to move them individually and clench my fists like normal.
