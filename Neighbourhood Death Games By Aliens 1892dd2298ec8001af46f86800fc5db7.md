# Description

While walking up the street to my unit complex atop a hill, an unidentified orange orb suddenly streaked across the sky, briefly concealing itself behind clouds. As it descended from afar, it revealed itself to be a cylindrical object with an octagon pattern seamlessly cut out of the exterior to reveal a glowing core. Upon contacting the ground, a colossal explosion occurred, accompanied by a towering orange mushroom cloud, causing everyone nearby to flee in fear.

The first challenge introduced a miniature hovering drone and everyone instinctively realized that they were on some form of twisted gameshow, competing for survival and racing to the finish line. Contestants toward the back were randomly vaporized by a blue laser periodically. To protect myself, I either hid behind others or held up large objects to obscure myself, in case it ever targeted me, although it never did. After sprinting inside a building across a red carpet and onto an elevated end podium, those behind me had a look of disappointment as they dematerialized into nothing.

The second challenge involved me entering a room to stand on a cylindrical podium beside an arcade machine that combined a basketball hoop with multiple shelves of items to knock over. A woman, presumably held against her will as a host, debriefed the challenge and instructed me to continue throwing balls until everything was satisfied. However, after a short delay, everything reset to its original state. When I asked how long other contestants took on average to complete the challenge, she nervously replied, "11 years.”
