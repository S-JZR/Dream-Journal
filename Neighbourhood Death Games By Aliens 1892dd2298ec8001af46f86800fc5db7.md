# Description

I was walking up the slanted street to my unit complex when a hollow lattice sphere with an octagonal pattern and glowing orange core streaked across the sky. Eventually, it descended to the ground in the distance and caused a large explosion with an orange mushroom cloud. Everyone instinctively realized that they were on a twisted gameshow competing for survival.

The first challenge involved racing to get inside a building while a hovering drone periodically fired blue lazers that vaporized random contestants at the back. To protect myself, I either hid behind others or held up large objects to obscure myself in case it ever targeted me. After sprinting inside a building across a red carpet and onto an elevated end podium, those behind me had a look of disappointment as they dematerialized into nothing.

The second challenge involved me entering a room to stand on a cylindrical podium beside an arcade machine that combined a basketball hoop with multiple shelves of items to knock over. A female host, presumably held against her will, stood in the room.

> **Woman**: Your challenge is to keep throwing the basketballs until all tasks are satisfied.
> 

> **Woman**: Everything will reset after a short delay.
> 

> **Me**: How long did other contestants take to finish on average?
> 

> **Woman**: ...
> 

> **Woman**: 11 years.
