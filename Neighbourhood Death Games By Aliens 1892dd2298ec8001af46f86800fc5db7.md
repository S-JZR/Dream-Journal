# Description

I was walking up the slanted street to my unit complex when a hollow lattice sphere with an octagonal pattern and glowing orange core streaked across the sky. Eventually, it descended to the ground in the distance and caused a large explosion with an orange mushroom cloud. Everyone instinctively realized that they were on a twisted gameshow competing for survival.

The first challenge involved racing to get inside a building while a hovering drone periodically fired blue lazers that vaporized random contestants at the back. To protect myself, I either hid behind others or held up large objects to obscure myself, in case it ever targeted me, although it never did. After sprinting inside a building across a red carpet and onto an elevated end podium, those behind me had a look of disappointment as they dematerialized into nothing.

The second challenge involved me entering a room to stand on a cylindrical podium beside an arcade machine that combined a basketball hoop with multiple shelves of items to knock over. A woman, presumably held against her will as a host, debriefed the challenge and instructed me to continue throwing balls until everything was satisfied. However, after a short delay, everything reset to its original state. When I asked how long other contestants took on average to complete the challenge, she nervously replied, "11 years.”
