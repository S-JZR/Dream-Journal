# Description

I was walking to a music concert in the park down the street at night, beside the playground, to investigate the loud music when I saw a crowd repeatedly jumped in place in front of the stage:

- parts:
    - main stage
    - wide side walls
- colours:
    - red and black
- lights:
    - large screen on the main stage
    - LEDs on the walls.
