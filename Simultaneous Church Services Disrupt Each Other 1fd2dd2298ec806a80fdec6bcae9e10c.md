# Description

Two church groups were sharing attendance in a large modern church building located in a semi-remote wooded area beside a road to simultaneously perform services:

- Left:
    - 75% metal chairs.
- Right:
    - 25% stackable plastic chairs.

The first group arrived early, occupied the metal chairs, and proceeded into a sermon led by a female pastor.

The second group arrived late, occupied the plastic chairs, and a female worship leader sang over the first service using a microphone, making it difficult to understand anything.

The pastor of the first group politely asked them using a microphone to lower their volume. The sound team at the back gradually reduced the volume to a suitable level.
