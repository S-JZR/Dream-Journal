# Description

I was in a black void standing in the only known city in existence when I grew tired of living there and decided to explore the universe to see what else was in it. After walking for some time, I looked back at the city in the distance when I realized that I risked leaving everything behind with no guarantee of finding anything. Instead of travelling across infinite space hoping to find something new or reach the end to satisfy my preconceived notion of completion, I could contribute to creating infinite complexity within a central point as society continued to innovate. Everything I ever needed was already within reach.

I returned to the city and entered a building with a woman showcasing her latest invention to a group of children around her but they were disinterested because they didn't understand its significance.

> **Woman**: This is my new barcode design that increases the total combinations by covering the entire surface with microscopic numbers.
> 

> **Me**: Can I have a look at the barcode?
> 

> **Woman**: Sure, here you go.
> 

I looked at the barcode closely and titled it, noticing that one side was an optically variable device that changed colours. I was overcome with amazement because we could go further into eternity without hitting boundaries and store more data in a single point.

> **Me**: Wow this is incredible!
> 

> **Me**: This will completely change the world!
> 

She showed a subtle smile and the children had confused expressions over why I was obsessed with it.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Thoughts:
    - I used to have a severe fear of infinity about things like:
        - Is it possible to reach the end of the universe? The expectation of trying to reach something potentially infinite felt impossible and made me feel forever trapped and incomplete. However, I changed my perspective to consider that achieving absolute completion may not involve travelling over space to experience everything natural in-person but instead understand the fundamental workings of reality and achieve all permutations of possibilities within a single point.
        - Does true infinity exist? Will infinite information exist and can we effectively store and retrieve it in a timely manner or we are limited to a finite cycle?

## Symbols

- Universe:
    - Feeling trapped and incomplete.
- City:
    - The current progress of knowledge and permutations of ideas.
- Turning Back:
    - The fear of losing what I already have.
- Microscopic Barcode:
    - Pushing the limits of what is possible.

## Lessons

- Think about problems from different perspectives and don't assume you have all the answers.
- Find the right audience that understands your work.
