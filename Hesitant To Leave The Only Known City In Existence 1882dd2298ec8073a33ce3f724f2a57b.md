# Description

I was standing in the only known city in existence surrounded by a black void when I grew tired of dwelling there and decided to explore the universe to see what else was in it. After walking for some time, I looked back at the city in the distance when it dawned on me that I risked leaving behind everything with no guarantee of finding anything. Opting to return, I recognised the opportunity to contribute towards creating infinite complexity within a central point as society continued to innovate. Everything I ever needed was already within reach.

Upon entering a building, a group of children gathered around a woman showcasing her latest invention, a barcode designed to drastically expand the combination limit by engraving the entire surface with microscopic numbers. The barcode reflected different colours at various angles, akin to the colour-shifting hologram on a banknote. The youths were quick to dismiss the idea, unaware of its significance, but I proceeded to express sincere gratitude and marvelled at it, eliciting a subtle smile from her.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I used to have a severe fear of infinity about things like:
    - Is it possible to reach the end of the universe? The expectation of trying to reach something potentially infinite felt impossible and made me feel forever trapped and incomplete. However, I changed my perspective to consider that achieving absolute completion may not involve travelling over space to experience everything natural in-person but instead understand the fundamental workings of reality and achieve all permutations of possibilities within a single point.
    - Does true infinity exist? Will infinite information exist and can we effectively store and retrieve it in a timely manner or we are limited to a finite cycle?

## Symbols

- Universe:
    - Feeling trapped and incomplete.
- City:
    - The current progress of knowledge and permutations of ideas.
- Turning Back:
    - The fear of losing what I already have.
- Microscopic Barcode:
    - Pushing the limits of what is possible.

## Lessons

- Think about problems from different perspectives and don't assume you have all the answers.
- Find the right audience that understands your work.
