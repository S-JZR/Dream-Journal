# Description

I was one of many secondary school students seated in the Digital Media Technology classroom as Mrs Brown started announcing the winners of an art competition at the front. I wasn’t expecting any awards but she said that I was voted crowd favourite and I walked up to receive a rectangular wooden lidded box with a gift card inside. She also mentioned that my brother had won an award but I told her that he was not present. Upon returning to my desk beside Katherine, I reflected on how one image could have such an effect on everyone and flipped through the corner of my art journal to catch glimpses of my old drawings.

Year 7 students nearby were still using laptops from the laptop trolley. One student forcibly shut down a laptop that had been carelessly placed inside while in hibernation. I rhetorically asked how long these laptops would last now that the government had replaced computer funding with BYOD.

Outside the classroom, I sat at an aluminium table with a middle-aged bearded bald man and fiddled with a strip of burlap. I told him that I was starting to go insane from everyday life and running out of creative ideas as even my dreams feel more creative than me. He affirmed and said we all go through periods like that.
