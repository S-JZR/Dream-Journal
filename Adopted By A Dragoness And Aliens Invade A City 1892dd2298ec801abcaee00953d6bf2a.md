# Description

I was standing in a remote desert town:

- Left:
    - Wooden rustic steakhouse.
- Right:
    - Concrete apartments with emergency staircases on their exteriors.

Due to perpetual shortages, when the steakhouse received shipments via a white semi-trailer truck, large crowds immediately congregated in a frenzy outside the store to buy sausages. Having missed a shipment for a prolonged period, the store owners resorted to allowing swarms of wandering caracal to slaughter customers already dining inside, utilizing their meat in cooking to make profits.

A giant black dragoness swooped down to terrorize people as they fled on the road between the apartments. I jumped onto a car and climbed the ladder on the side of the apartments to safety.

> **Dragoness**: You're aerobic abilities are quite impressive.
> 

> **Dragoness**: I’m going to adopt you.
> 

She picked me up in her hand and flew away. While living with a miniature version of the dragoness in my unit for some time I overheard her talking on the phone.

> **Dragoness**: Don't worry about me Sheryl.
> 

> **Dragoness**: If I ever become pregnant I'll just eat his entire family to feed my children.
> 

Disturbed by this revelation I met with my family.

> **Me**: We’re not safe here and the dragoness plans to eat us all!
> 

> **Me**: We need to leave now!
> 

> **Mum**: I doubt she meant that.
> 

> **Mum**: Why don’t we just wait and see?
> 

I fled by climbing over the back fence and hitching a ride to the city. A group of aliens with human appearances, conquered the city, imposing imperial rule and enforcing citizen disarmament. Upon arriving, a group and I were compelled to proceed through a long wide hall, walking on a white strip with a series of exhibition windows on the right side. Halfway through, a rectangular segment of the floor beneath me glowed orange, and a guard approached from behind to check if I was a rebel.

> **Guard**: Turn around.
> 

> **Guard**: Would you prefer to own shoes with built-in guns, grenades, bubbles containing explosive chemicals, or plain bubbles?
> 

> **Me**: Plain bubbles.
> 

The guard left and I continued to an exhibition window with plasma screen TVs showcasing different occupations:

- Translating.
- Cooking.
- Programming videogames. The videogame showed connected clusters of light-yellow hexagons overlaid with a red line pathfinding to reach a target offscreen as the camera tracked it.

I travelled further into a T-junction hallway and the main room:

- inside:
    - left:
        - coffee kiosk
    - middle:
        - fruit stands
    - right:
        - empty horse stalls with hay
        - bathroom cubicles
        - store with a glass window
- outside:
    - left:
        - Pale green aliens imitating cows on a dirt path
    - middle:
        - Open grass field
        - Hexagon gazebo
    - right:
        - People swimming in a large lake
    - background:
        - Forest.

While standing at the front door a humanoid alien taskmaster approached me.

> **Taskmaster**: Supplies must be gathered and sorted into the appropriate locations.
> 

> **Taskmaster**: Don’t approach the “Weed Cows” in the distance as they’re hostile.
> 

> **Taskmaster**: If they attack, feed them the special green cubes from storage to calm them down.
> 

> **Taskmaster**: Everyone must pass a lethal two-level gauntlet to permanently stay here.
> 

I realized it was necessary to escape to avoid being killed.

The Grinch entered the room behind me.

> **Grinch**: I’m in need of people who can deliver a menacing evil laugh.
> 

> **Me**: Muhahaha!
> 

> **Grinch**: That's a start but I'll take it.
> 

> **Grinch**: Follow me to the store to meet with the others.
> 

While travelling through the hallway I was experimenting with different variations of the laugh.

> **Grinch**: Stop that dreadful racket it sounds worse than before!
> 

> **Grinch**: Gah! Go back I haven’t got a single second to waste on a dreamer!
> 

I returned to the main room and travelled to the Gazebo outside when the taskmaster jumped on my back, expecting me to give him a piggyback ride until we reached it. Suddenly, the alien cows became agitated, stood on their hind legs, and grew to around four-stories tall. They lumbered towards swimmers in the lake and came close to a man with his back turned. A few people beside me noticed.

> **People**: Get out of the water!
> 

> **People**: The “Weed Cows” are coming!
> 

Everyone fled back inside and the area entered a lockdown as sirens played. A few individuals searched for the green cubes but they were missing so everyone hid in various places. I attempted to find a spot with the fewest people but the horse stables and bathroom stalls were occupied.

> **Woman**: Go somewhere else!
> 

I entered the hallway but rolling corrugated metal doors sealed all entrances. I frantically circled around places until someone oblivious to the situation unlocked the left hallway door. I rushed through.

> **Me**: Shut the door!
> 

After entering a large two-storey food court I considered returning to the dragoness but deemed it too risky and considered other places to seek refuge.
