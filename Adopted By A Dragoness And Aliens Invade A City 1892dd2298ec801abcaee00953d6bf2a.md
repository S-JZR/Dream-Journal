# Description

I was in a remote desert expanse tinged with orange hues, surrounded by modern buildings loosely arranged in a rectangular formation. Among them stood a rustic steakhouse crafted entirely from wooden planks, offering a diverse selection of meats, and concrete three-story apartment buildings with emergency staircases on their exteriors. Due to perpetual shortages, when the steakhouse received shipments via a white semi-trailer truck, large crowds immediately congregated in a frenzy outside the store to buy sausages. Having missed a shipment for a prolonged period, the store owners resorted to allowing swarms of wandering caracal to slaughter customers already dining inside, utilizing their meat in cooking to make profits.

Subsequently, an intelligent black giant dragoness began swooping down to terrorize people as they fled in fear on the road between the apartments. However, impressed by my aerobic ability to climb up the ladder to safety, she decided to adopt me. While living with a miniature version of the dragoness in my unit, I overheard her ominous threat to consume my family to feed her offspring should she ever become pregnant. Disturbed by this revelation, I promptly urged everyone to flee, explaining the perilous circumstances, but they opted to stay in doubtful hesitation. Without further delay, I climbed over the back fence and hitched a ride to the city.

A group of aliens with human appearances, conquered the city, imposing imperial rule and enforcing citizen disarmament. Upon arrival, a group and I were compelled to proceed through a long wide hall, walking on a white strip with a series of exhibition windows on the right side. Halfway through, a rectangular segment of the floor beneath me glowed orange, prompting a guard from behind to demand that I turn around. They began issuing leading questions, aiming to identify potential rebels, by asking whether I preferred weaponry or a non-lethal item. Examples included shoes with built-in guns, and grenades, bubbles with varying explosive chemical compositions, or a plain one. After passing, I proceeded to exhibition windows with plasma screen TVs showcasing various occupations to choose from including translating different languages, cooking, and programming video games. The featured video game showed various connected clusters of light-yellow hexagons overlaid with an expanding red pathfinding path trying to reach a point offscreen as the camera panned.

I entered a room to encounter:

- Inside:
    - Left:
        - Coffee kiosk.
    - Middle:
        - Fruit stands.
    - Right:
        - Empty horse stalls with hay.
        - Bathroom cubicles.
        - Store with a glass window.
- Outside:
    - Left:
        - Pale green aliens imitating cows on a dirt path.
    - Middle:
        - Open grass field.
        - Hexagon gazebo.
    - Right:
        - People swimming in a large lake.
    - Background:
        - Forest.

A humanoid alien taskmaster approached to debrief me about the expected workload, emphasizing the importance of ensuring supplies are gathered and sorted in appropriate locations. They cautioned against approaching the hostile cows, nicknamed "weed cows," and advised feeding them special green cubes to deter them if they attack. Additionally, they mentioned that to stay permanently, everyone is required to eventually pass a lethal gauntlet with two levels, making me realize the necessity to escape.

While standing near the front door, the Grinch arrived, seeking recruits for a special class of individuals capable of delivering a menacing evil laugh. After satisfying his desires, he allowed me to follow him, but when experimenting with different variations on the way that were less direct and slower, he told me to stop since they were worse. In the other building, a few other people were present, but I forgot what else occurred and returned. While wandering toward the central Gazebo, the taskmaster, for whatever reason, decided to piggyback me until reaching it.

Suddenly, the alien cows became agitated, standing on their hind legs and growing taller as they towered over us. Individuals beside me began calling out to the swimmers, warning them of the impending danger as a cow lumbered closer to someone with their back turned. As the others started moving in our direction, I immediately bolted back without hesitation. The area went into lockdown as a siren played, but the green substance needed to calm the cows was missing, forcing personnel to seek refuge in various rooms. Attempting to find a spot with fewer people, I entered the horse stable, only to find it occupied. I then entered the left bathroom stall but was scolded by an adjacent woman who insisted I go somewhere else. Upon entering the front T-junction hallway, metal doors sealed all entrances. With dwindling options, I frantically circled around places until by some stroke of luck, someone unlocked the left hallway door, seemingly oblivious to the situation. I rushed through, urging him to shut it behind me. After entering a large food court with two stories of stores, I considered returning to my dragoness adoptive parent but deemed it too risky and pondered other possible solutions.
