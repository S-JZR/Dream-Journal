# Description

I was with a middle-age man and woman standing inside empty trenches when a disembodied male voice started prophesying over us. It told the man that he was an imbecile who wouldn't amount to anything significant in life. After hearing this, I worried about what it would say about me, and it declared that I would become the leader of a great British army that would inevitably fail.

I don’t remember what was said to the woman.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I constantly criticise my short comings.

## Symbols

- Trenches: the mind can be a warzone where we battle self-criticism and external judgements.
- Bad prophecies: my inner critic doubts I will be successful and labels me incompetent, foolish, not good enough, overly ambitious, and disorganized.

## Lessons

- Don’t internalize external judgments or they can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
