# Description

I was standing inside trenches with a middle-age man and woman when a disembodied adult male voice started giving bad prophecies over us and we each feared what it would say.

> **Male voice**: (to man) you’re an imbecile who will never amount to anything in life.
**Male voice**: (to woman) you’re too afraid to take risks and will never achieve anything.
**Male voice**: (to me) you will become the leader of a great British army that will inevitably fail.
