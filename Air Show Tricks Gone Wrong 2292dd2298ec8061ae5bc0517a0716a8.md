# Description

I was standing on the oval of my primary school during an air show, watching various WWI twin-boom aircraft circle the sky, showcasing their skills. TV presenters were at the nearby administration building beneath fictional trees. As a stunt, the pilots gradually flew closer to various trees, scrapping past branches and passing through gaps. The engines of one aircraft cut out, making it plummet to the ground, crashing into the tree at the presenters and covering them at a slant. After walking over to investigate, I saw them climbing down from the central fuselage. When another pilot landed nearby, I gave a thumbs-up to signal that everything was fine and they took off again.
