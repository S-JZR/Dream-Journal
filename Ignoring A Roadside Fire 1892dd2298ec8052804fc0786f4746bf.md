# Description

I was seated in my mum's car with my family being driven by my mum towards my secondary school. After leaving the roundabout, I noticed a slight grey smog in bushland to the left, revealing concentrated beams of sunlight igniting it. I suggested calling the fire department, but my parents reassured me that someone else would surely do it upon noticing the rising black smoke. Upon returning to the same roundabout via a different route, we approached a dark red sky ahead with a row of fictional apartments on the right. Those at the back completely melted into metal skeletons with a few remnants of walls intact before collapsing, whereas those in front were beginning to combust from the ground up. Various fire trucks manoeuvred past lines of cars halted behind a vacated cordoned-off area marked by yellow restriction tape wrapped around streetlights across all lanes. Despite efforts to contain the spread, the situation escalated into an uncontrollable catastrophe, as everything nearby gradually succumbed to flames.
