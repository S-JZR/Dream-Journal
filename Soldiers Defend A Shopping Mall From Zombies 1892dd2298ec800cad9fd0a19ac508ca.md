# Description

Situated on a remote hill beside a road between two towering smooth concrete buildings, a hoard of zombies emerged from afar, sprinting closer. Fleeing with hundreds of nearby military personnel inside the furthest building across the road, other zombies already indoors ambushed the senior general, leaving him injured as two recruits slowly tried pulling him up the square stairwell while others sought personal safety. Offering support, I grabbed onto his back for additional force, but eventually realizing that the area would soon become overrun, I opted that we continue ascending the staircase without him to avoid dying. Whilst moving, we began firing shots from the railings to supress the advancement of zombies flooding upwards as others on higher levels joined in to help.

In the wide white hallway of a single-storey shopping mall with an elevated ceiling and various central kiosks and side stores, I stood with someone else, posing as realistic humanoid robots sent from the future to warn of an impending zombie outbreak. Assuring them that we were not human, our limbs rotated with precision as we looked at them, but they refrained from listening and departed, regarding us as insane adults.
