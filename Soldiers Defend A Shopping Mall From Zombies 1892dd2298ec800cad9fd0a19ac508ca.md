# Description

I was one of many soldiers standing on a remote hill beside a road between two tall smooth concrete buildings when a distant hoard of zombies sprinted towards us. We fled inside the nearest building as zombies already infiltrated it and ambushed the senior general, leaving him injured as two recruits struggled to pull him up the square stairwell. I grabbed onto his back to offer additional support but acknowledged the area would soon be overrun.

> **Me**: We can’t make it in time!
> 

> Me: We need to leave him or we will die!
> 

Whilst moving, we began firing shots from the railings to supress the advancement of zombies flooding upwards as others on higher levels joined in to help.

I was one of two realistic humanoid robots sent from the future into a wide white hallway of a shopping mall with an elevated ceiling and various central kiosks and side stores. Our limbs rotated with precision as we looked at people.

> **Me**: In a few weeks from now there will be a zombie outbreak!
> 

> **Me**: You must prepare or you will perish!
> 

> **Me**: We are robots from the future!
> 

Everyone thought we were insane and started walking away from us.
