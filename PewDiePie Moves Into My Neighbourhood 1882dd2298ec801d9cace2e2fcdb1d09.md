# Description

I was standing in my unit when word spread that PewDiePie moved into the neighbourhood. Perplexed by the decision to be in my Australian suburb, I figured it was for cheaper rent. I knocked multiple times next door, and a senior man with short grey hair answered. Upon inquiring where PewDiePie lived, he gestured to look across the road at the large house with disco lights and a lively crowd. I rushed over to discover that PewDiePie was hosting a birthday party for the entire neighbourhood.

Feeling obligated to contribute, I initially considered offering some candy that materialized in my hand. However, seeing the abundance of food already present and not wanting to attract attention, I discreetly hid the sweets in my fist, anxious about being perceived as greedy or solely there for self-indulgence.

As the event moved outside along the street, everything seemed normal until I noticed a laptop on a wooden table playing a video of someone flirting with Marzia Kjellberg before she met PewDiePie, but everyone else was distracted.
