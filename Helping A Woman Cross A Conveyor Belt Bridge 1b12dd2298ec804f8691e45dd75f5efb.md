# Description

An elderly Asian woman in a shopping mall struggled to use a powered roller conveyor bridge connecting the two halves of the second floor. It detected the direction customers were moving and displayed arrows on square screens mounted on parallel poles at each entrance. I demonstrated how to use it by standing fully on it, sliding a bit, and letting it carry me to the other side. We repeated this together three times.
