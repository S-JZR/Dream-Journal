# Description

I was one of many secondary school students learning to swim in a rectangular grey concrete room while being supervised by a female teacher:

- Left:
    - Wide platform.
- Middle:
    - Pool.
- Right:
    - Narrow platform with a central rectangular tank and side glass window.

During the first activity everyone was tasked with crossing the pool that periodically and rapidly filled and drained, with a few floating foam platforms loosely arranged in a line on the surface. Some students quickly swam to the other side before the water drained. Julien clung to a rectangular hovercraft with four side fans as he slid across the ceiling to the other side, where it abruptly dropped and landed on him, prompting nearby students to lift it off his body.

During the second activity everyone was tasked with swimming across the pool and diving into the pitch black right tank to pickup a baby crocodile in their mouth and return to place it in a plastic container. I was afraid to dive deep underwater from past experiences and hold a flailing baby crocodile that could injure me. Some students noticing my nervousness tried to assure me it wasn’t that deep and there was plenty of time to hold my breathe but I stayed out. Halfway through the activity, the supervising teacher left the room. One returning male student mistakenly held the crocodile with his hands and proceeded to deliver it despite everyone yelling he was doing it wrong since he couldn’t be bothered repeating it. Others realized they could make compromises while the teacher was away and did it themselves. When most students had finished, the teacher called me into the side administration room in the outer hallway to ask why I wasn’t participating and warned that I wouldn’t be able to continue unless I completed the activity since these were fundamental skills.
