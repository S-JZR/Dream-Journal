# Description

I was exiting a shopping mall in the USA into a carpark towards a spot beside the main road with a four-layer strip of boulders. A bearded dragon climbed a boulder on the first-layer at the front and hid inside a crevice. A bald elderly man with a white beard ascended through the top layer of boulders via a deep ladder emerging from the sewers. He told me to flee, as zombies had emerged in the State of Washington and were spreading across the country to infect everyone.

A horde of zombies began roaming across the car park from the right side, so I fled to the left and went to the top floor of a nearby multi-storey building. I called my mum to relay the situation and urged her to buy as many packs of single-use plastic water bottles and soup cans as possible and have them delivered to our home so we could wait out the apocalypse. However, she was hesitant due to not believing me and wanting to avoid wasting money.
