# Description

I was standing beside the front administration building of my secondary school with other students from primary school, arguing over religion. When a boy question how God could exist lighting flashed across the overcast sky. Treating it as a mere coincidence, he continued asking several other questions, only for lightning to consistently strike the ground by our feet, leaving him astonished and unable to comprehend it. Eventually, since God exclusively responded to him, he developed an elitist mentality, considering himself as a chosen messiah. He began assembling a death cult with nearby peers who readily joined after witnessing his strong divine connection.

Feeling uncomfortable with the situation, many of us sought to escape by travelling along the bushwalk and footpath to the right of the school, but other cult members used intimidation to keep everyone confined. Desperate to find another means of escape, I rang my mother and relayed the situation as she promised to swiftly to pick me up. As many gathered in major parts of the school, I noticed a few hiding out in distant buildings, so I approached them. A multitude of police officers nearby proceeded to raid the area, searching our backpacks for prohibited items as we escaped.

Eventually, my mother’s car arrived along the street as I entered while carpooling with another student who asked to be driven to a neighbourhood beside mine. However, she quickly forgot about his presence. Upon noticing the half-depleted fuel tank nearing home, she decided to find the nearest gas station. After reminding her that he was in the back, I insisted that we should find one in the other neighbourhood since it will be easier to drop him off afterwards.
