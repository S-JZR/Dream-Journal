# Description

I was with a group of students and a teacher from my secondary school in a small empty garage preparing items for charity. One wall was lined with cartons filled with smaller food boxes. Being new to the event, I wasn’t sure how to organize the items on the floor. Eventually, all the goods were wrapped into small cubes and only one was loaded per trip onto an indoor docked Work Punt boat with an awning. I chose to drive the boat and carefully exited, making a sharp 90 degree turn left to avoid colliding with alley walls. Once on a wide river there were various other students doing the same thing. We all travelled over a moderate distance to drop off the packages at a warehouse and returned for more.
