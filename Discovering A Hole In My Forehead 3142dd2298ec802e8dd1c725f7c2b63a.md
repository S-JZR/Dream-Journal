# Description

I was one of many secondary students sitting at desks in a side makeshift English classroom in the library when I placed my hand onto my forehead to lean on it and realized there was a 5cm semi-circle hole. I kept touching the hole during the class because it made me feel uncomfortable and I wanted it gone.
