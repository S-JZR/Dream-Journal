# Description

I was playing a war tycoon videogame on Roblox with a map featuring terrain encircled by various rivers and players purchased large fortified sci-fi bases. I saved up money to buy one of the most expensive vehicles, an underwater scooter with a 50 barrel minigun on the front, but it turned out to be absolute garbage as one of the slowest moving vehicles that I didn’t want to use.

The developer release an update the next day that completely overhauled the entire game and the vehicle was now the fastest and worked on water and land. I decided to troll other players by gliding towards a tall grey tower where two friends were talking to each other on VR chat. They saw me approaching and fled up an orange square wind elevator to a higher floor and I followed them up. They ran in a loop around a square room with glass windows and a hole to the lower floor in the centre. I had a default Roblox Noob skin equipped and they were confused.

> **Boy 1**: There’s an NPC chasing us!
**Boy 2**: That’s not an NPC!
> 

While they looped around the square room I gained on them and burst fired to down them.
