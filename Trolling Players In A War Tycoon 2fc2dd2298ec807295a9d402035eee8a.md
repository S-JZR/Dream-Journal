# Description

I was playing a war tycoon videogame on Roblox featuring multiple islands surrounded by rivers where players purchased large fortified sci-fi bases. I saved up enough money to buy an underwater scooter with a 50 barrel minigun on the front, one of the most expensive vehicles in the game. However, it turned out to be garbage with one of the slowest movement speeds and I refused to use it.

The developer released an update the next day that overhauled the entire game and the vehicle was now the fastest and compatible with water and land. I decided to troll other players by gliding towards a tall grey tower where two friends were talking to each other on VR chat. They saw me approaching and fled up an orange square wind elevator to a higher floor and I followed them up. They ran in circles around a square room with continuous glass windows and a square hole in the centre leading to the lower floor. I had the default Roblox Noob skin equipped which confused them.

> **Boy 1**: There’s an NPC chasing us!
> 

> **Boy 2**: That’s not an NPC!
> 

While they looped around the square room, I gained on them and burst fired to down them.
