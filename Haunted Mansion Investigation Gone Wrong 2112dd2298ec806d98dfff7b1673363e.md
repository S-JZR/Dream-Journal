# Description

I was walking into an abandoned black gothic haunted mansion to document any paranormal activity on a handheld camcorder:

- Front:
    - Red carpet runner that stretched forward and ascended a bifurcated staircase.
    - Various furniture densely packed together on both sides of the carpet.
- Left:
    - Side room.
- Right:
    - Black upright piano with a brown kitten resting on the keys with its belly.
- Floor:
    - Wooden floorboards.

As the keys started to play by themselves, they repeatedly moved the kittens paws up and down as it ignored it and kept starring off into the distance. All the furniture shifted slightly toward me with the sound of scraping floorboards, prompting me to flee to the double front doors but they slammed shut and wouldn’t budge. Fearing for my safety, I jumped through the left stained glass window, shattering it, and landed onto the front lawn to escape.
