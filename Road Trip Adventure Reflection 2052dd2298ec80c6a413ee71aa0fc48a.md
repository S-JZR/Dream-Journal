# Description

I was seated at my computer in my unit and emulated Road Trip Adventure, one of my favourite childhood videogames. While exploring the world, I found various candid screenshots on my computer showing the locations of secret treasure chests in different terrain. However, I realized my childhood efforts were a waste of time as it lacked spatial context and would have been better documented on something like a Fandom map, allowing everyone to easily find each point.

After digging through the code, I toggled different developer flags that unlocked all buildings in My City. I reflected on how:

- Progress in video games is an arbitrary construct.
- Investing excessive time to achieve everything is unproductive, especially as modern games get longer or if the platforms eventually shutdown and all data is lost.
- One could easily modify the code, execute commands to obtain any item, or watch others’ gameplay online who achieve everything.
- Players are merely agreeing to engage in an adventure predefined by developers and being confined to its available choices and rules for the thrill of growth, strategy, and seeing a narrative unfold.
- Everyone should only take what they need and move on.
- Any undocumented experience will be forgotten anyway.

## Lessons

- Videogames are arbitrary constructs so be careful how much time you spend on them.
- Undocumented experiences are forgotten forever.

# Notes

- I added a brain dump of thoughts I've been having lately as a list.
