# Description

I was seated beside my dad at the dining table with a large all-in-one computer on top that we regularly use during the weekend. He was browsing the internet and clicked on what seemed like a SpongeBob episode on a random website to watch for the sake of it. However, it showed a slow-motion pornographic scene of a naked woman jumping in a grassy field at multiple angles. I said that someone must have uploaded it with a fake thumbnail to hide it or lure others into a trap. We felt that it was inappropriate and he closed the website.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- SpongeBob: sometimes my dad stops to watch children’s TV shows to see what they’re showing the next generation.
- In the past I have reported two YouTube profiles and one Internet Archive profile that featured kids cartoons alongside porn. I don’t know if they were intentionally trying to corrupt the youth or hide content from moderators.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Review content from unofficial sources to ensure it’s safe and legitimate.
