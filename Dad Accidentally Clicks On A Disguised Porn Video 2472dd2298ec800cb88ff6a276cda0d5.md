# Description

I was seated beside my dad at the dining table with a large all-in-one computer on top that we regularly use during the weekend. He was browsing the internet and clicked on what seemed like a SpongeBob episode on a random website to watch for the sake of it. However, it showed a slow-motion pornographic scene of a naked woman jumping in a grassy field at multiple angles. I said that someone must have uploaded it with a fake thumbnail to hide it or lure others into a trap. We felt that it was inappropriate and he closed the website.
