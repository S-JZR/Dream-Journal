# Description

I was one of many students moving into the hall at my secondary school for a special assembly where Liam dressed as Elvis held onto the side of a central giant disco ball suspended by a chain.

> **Liam**: I'm going to perform a song for someone dear to me here today.
> 

> **Liam**: But first let's start with the daily announcements.
> 

> **Liam**: [Discussing the announcements].
> 

After speaking for a while, many students zoned out, and upon finishing he walked out without performing as everyone sat in silence.

> **Man**: Wait, wasn't he supposed to sing something?
> 

> **Woman**: Yeah, he didn't do anything.
> 

> **Students**: *Muttering*
