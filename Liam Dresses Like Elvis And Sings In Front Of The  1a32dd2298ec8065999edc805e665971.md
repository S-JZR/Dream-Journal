# Description

I was one of many students moving into the hall at my secondary school for a special assembly where Liam dressed as Elvis hung from the side of a central giant disco ball suspended by a chain. He explained that he was going to perform a song for a student in the audience but first proceeded to deliver the daily announcements from the school administration. After speaking for a while, many students zoned out, and upon finishing he simply walked outside without performing. While sitting in silence, a few students realized he didn't sing as promised and they grew annoyed as they spread the word which sparked a commotion of everyone talking to their peers.
