# Description

I was standing in the carpark of my unit complex, witnessing three individuals sharing a firearm self-defence technique to force an aggressor's legs together by ricocheting bullets off the ground and walls into their pelvis that was demonstrated on a dummy.

> **People**: Let's move to the farthest garage to practice since it will be safer.
> 

They entered the garage and shut the front corrugated steel door. Suddenly, the back wall vanished, prompting me to approach the experiment from the other side. A woman handed me her safety earmuffs.

> **Woman**: I need you to supervise the shooter.
> 

However, the dread of a deafening gunshot reverberating within the enclosed space and the potential for misfires compelled me to hesitantly remain outside.

Eventually, I strolled along the concrete pathway to the right side of the garage, where two garbage bins are normally positioned, now two pits containing various foliage. The area was inhabited by wildlife, including koalas hanging from trees and a Komodo dragon on the ground, eagerly anticipating their descent. I returned to the garage.

> **Me**: Don't shoot! You will scare the animals away!
> 

Everyone walked over to investigate and we took photos of the animals. I was instantly teleported into a science classroom in my secondary school where I presented my findings with a slideshow projected at the front to the class. Dejan, a friend from secondary school, transitioned through the slides on a laptop.

> **Dejan**: (muttering) Are these photos even real?
