# Description

I was standing in the carpark of my unit complex, witnessing three individuals sharing a firearm self-defence technique to force an aggressor's legs together by ricocheting bullets off the ground and walls into their pelvis. After a successful demonstration with a dummy, they opted to reproduce the process in a safer environment by entering the farthest garage and shutting the front corrugated steel door. Suddenly, the back wall vanished, prompting me to approach the experiment from the other side. One of the women handed me her safety earmuffs and requested that I supervise the gun operator during the discharge. However, the dread of a deafening gunshot reverberating within the enclosed space and the potential for misfires compelled me to hesitantly remain outside.

Eventually, I strolled along the concrete pathway to the right side of the garage, where two garbage bins are normally positioned, now two pits containing various foliage. The area was inhabited by wildlife, including koalas hanging from trees and a Komodo dragon on the ground, eagerly anticipating their descent. Realizing that withholding the gunfire prevented them from fleeing the loud noise, I warned the others before we began capturing photos. Unexpectedly, I found myself in a crowded classroom, tasked with contributing my findings to a slideshow projected at the front. Dejan, a friend from secondary school, operated the computer for the presentation, sceptically questioning the authenticity of each photo to himself.
