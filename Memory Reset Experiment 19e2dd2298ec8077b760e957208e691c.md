# Description

In a room with rectangular windows, various people were undergoing an experiment to have their memories erased by scientists with the push of a button at the end of each testing period. After a long break, I returned to speak with a middle-aged female test subject whom I had some relationship with. However, she claimed to have never known me, which upset me. The resets gradually increased in frequency, shortening from a year to a day. Seeing a timelapse of those individuals trapped in a loop, unable to grow, made me feel even worse.
