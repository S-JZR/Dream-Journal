# Description

Various people were seated in a room with long rectangular windows undergoing a memory reset experiment where scientists in an observation room pushed a red button to erase all memories that occurred during the testing period. After being away for a few months, I returned to speak with a middle-aged female test subject whom I had some relationship with. However, I was too late and she claimed to have never known me which was upsetting. The resets gradually increased in frequency, shortening from a year to a day. Seeing a timelapse of those individuals trapped in a loop, unable to grow, made me feel even worse.
