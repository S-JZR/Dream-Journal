# Description

I was a member of a spy gang navigating through environments. Engaged in a free-for-all gamemode, our task involved locating simple slick cartoonish vehicles scattered across the map like a dirt bike, car, tank, and plane. Unfortunately, others reached them first, prompting me to retreat to the back of the map where I eventually met my demise. After respawning, I encountered the peculiar sight of a kid's train ride within a children's workshop and play area. Activating the mechanism, I embarked on a whimsical journey along a designated route, weaving through a series of tunnels that led to a playground.

Suddenly, I was collaborating with the team again, collecting money scattered throughout the environment to unlock small cardboard vehicles buried amidst miscellaneous junk on the playground. Despite my suggestion to choose the car, the team swiftly opted for the plane atop the pile. Nearing the required one million price tag, an unforeseen glitch prevented our wealth from combining. The richest member refused to cover the cost and proposed that everyone should beg strangers for additional funds.

After exiting through the front door, we encountered various police officers lined up to the right in front of their vehicles. Instinctively, we all dashed down the left side of a small hill in search of getaway vehicles as some team members were tackled to the ground. Leaping into a nearby river revealed someone in a floating car, and as they swung open the door, we navigated together into a large sewer pipe, effectively sealing our escape.
