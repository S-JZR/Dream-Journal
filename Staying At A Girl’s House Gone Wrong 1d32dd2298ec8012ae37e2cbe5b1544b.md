# Description

While it was raining, a young girl approached the front flyscreen door and asked for help. Thinking it was a serious issue, I exited outside to follow her down the footpath as the rain cleared instantly upon contact, revealing the sun. She led me to a white fold-out table on the footpath beside unit 1 where I sat next to her and across from her adult sister who was closer to the unit. She asked me to help identify her dream boyfriend using an electronic rectangular cyan pen holder on the table that responded to questions when a pen was inserted into the slot. I asked if he was an international student, to which she said yes, and if he was lonely, to which she said yes again.

The girl invited me to stay at her two-storey unit that transformed into a large house for a while as night fell. She mentioned that her mother, Margarette, was almost home, but something felt off as they remained eerily quiet. I briefly hid in the coatrack in the lounge room to spy on them, but nothing occurred. I called over a few friends to explore the house with me and see if they could find anything strange.

Eventually, a distant loud roar echoed throughout the house and she said that her mother finally arrived. Assuming Margarette would enter through the front entrance, I sprinted to the furthest room, only to unexpectedly find a long medieval hallway with a red carpet. As a loud roar echoed in the hallway, I realized she was about to emerge from there, so I turned around to warm my friends to hide as they quickly found various spots like in the closet and under the bed. I rushed into an adjacent bathroom, smashed the window with an air freshener can, scrapped away leftover glass, and climbed onto a thick external pipe to slide down to the backyard. I climbed the wooden fence in the backyard and sprinted away through the neighbourhood streets. While calling the police, my voice changed to another panicked male teenager, whimpering as I relayed the situation. They asked whether I needed urgent help when I heard heard distant footsteps and turned around to see Margaret, a tall pale figure in a light blue dress with long black hair, power walking towards me. I yelled into the phone, “Yes, please send help, I'm being chased!”. They asked for the street name, but unable to see it, I gave them a nearby street that turned off. Growing weary of running, I kept glancing back and forth, seeing Margaret getting closer. I feared she would jump scare me in front like a stereotypical horror movie but when I ran under a streetlamp and looked back, it suddenly turned to daylight, and she was gone.

After encountering a train station ahead, it transformed into a day care, and I was transported into a dark grey textured void, with the the entire plot of land floating within it. I walked along a narrow external strip of laminated floorboards, passing a few children standing on it, to enter a room where various children sat at tables doing various activities beneath a dark blue awning stretched across the open ceiling. I climbed onto the awning and reached the side of the wall, where children pointed out heaps of clustered bird droppings on it in disgust. I rhetorically asked them, "But where are the birds?" causing them to fall silent in bewilderment. I noticed a child standing on a protruding strip of floor on the other side, curiously gazing down into the void. He jumped down, landing on an invisible floor, and vanished into red particles. I asked the children what happened, and one casually replied, "He's dead.” I climbed down from the wall, walked back to the narrow strip, but now it was crowded with more children blocking my way. A girl who resembled Margarette’s daughter accidentally bumped someone and began falling into it. I yelled for Margarette to save her but nothing occurred so it must have been someone else. I suddenly remembered that I was still on the phone with police and asked if they were still there when a distorted voice said that Margarette created this entire world as a flat image of her ghastly face appeared, blending into the top of the void.
