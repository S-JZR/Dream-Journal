# Description

I was standing in my unit when a girl approached the front flyscreen door while it was raining.

> **Girl**: Can you help me?
> 

Thinking it was a serious issue, I exited outside to follow her down the footpath as the rain cleared instantly upon contact, revealing the sun. She led me to a white fold-out table on the footpath beside unit 1 where I sat next to her and across from her adult sister who was closer to the unit.

> **Girl**: Can you help identify my dream boyfriend?
**Girl**: You just ask this electronic rectangular cyan pen holder a question then insert the pen and it gives the answer.
**Me**: Is he an international student?
**Girl**: Yes.
**Me**: Is he lonely?
**Girl**: Yes.
**Girl**: Would you like to stay at our place for a while.
Me: Sure.
> 

I stayed at her two-storey unit that transformed into a large house for a while as night fell.

> **Girl**: My mother, Margarette, is almost home.
> 

Something felt off as they remained eerily quiet. I briefly hid in the coatrack in the lounge room to spy on them but nothing occurred. I called over a few friends to help me explore the house for anything strange.

> **Margarette**: (Distant) Roar!
**Girl**: Mother has finally arrived.
> 

Assuming Margarette would enter through the front door, I sprinted to the furthest room, only to unexpectedly find a long medieval hallway with a red carpet.

> **Margarette**: (Echo) Roar!
> 

I realized she was about to emerge from the hallway so I turned around to warm my friends to hide as they quickly found various spots in the closet and under the bed. I rushed into an adjacent bathroom, smashed the window with an air freshener can, scrapped away leftover glass, and climbed onto a thick external pipe to slide down to the backyard. I climbed the wooden fence in the backyard and sprinted away through the neighbourhood streets. While calling the police, my voice changed to that of another panicked teenager.

> **Me**: *Whimpering* [recalling the situation].
**Operator**: Do you need urgent help?
> 

I heard distant footsteps and turned around to see Margaret, a tall pale figure in a light blue dress with long black hair, power walking towards me.

> **Me**: Yes! Please send help, I'm being chased!
**Operator**: What is your street address?
**Me**: I’m not sure but there’s a turn-off called Maple Street.
> 

I grew weary of running and repeatedly glanced back and forth, seeing Margaret getting closer. I feared she would jump scare me in front like a stereotypical horror movie but when I ran under a streetlamp and looked back it suddenly turned to daylight and she disappeared.

After encountering a train station ahead, it transformed into a day care, and I was transported into a dark grey textured void, with the entire plot of land floating within it. I walked along a narrow external strip of laminated floorboards, passing a few children standing on it, to enter a room where various children sat at tables doing various activities beneath a dark blue awning stretched across the open ceiling. I climbed onto the awning and reached the side of the wall, where children pointed out heaps of clustered bird droppings on it in disgust.

> **Me**: But where are the birds…?
**Children**: …
> 

I noticed a boy standing on a protruding strip of floor on the other side, curiously gazing down into the void. He jumped down and turned into red particles that slowly vanished.

> **Me**: What happened to him?
**Girl 2**: He’s dead.
> 

I climbed down from the wall, walked back to the narrow strip, but now it was crowded with more children blocking my way. A girl who resembled Margarette’s daughter accidentally bumped someone and began falling into the void.

> **Me**: Margarette, I think your daughter is about to die! You better save her!
> 

However, nothing occurred so it must have been someone else. I suddenly remembered that I was still on the phone with the operator.

> **Me**: Hey are you still there?
**Distorted Voice**: Margarette created this entire world.
> 

I looked around and saw Margarette’s ghastly face blending into the top of the void.
