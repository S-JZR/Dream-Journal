# Description

I was seated with my family in my mum's car being driven by my mum to a veterans resort to meet someone. We noticed two connected tennis ball courts beside the complex when we pulled into the parking lot and decided to play a game. However, before entering, a cleaning crew suddenly brought in their equipment to wash the floors, and a ride-on floor scrubber leaked a small white puddle near the entrance.

> **Me**: Excuse me, what is that substance on the ground?
**Man**: It’s a toxic cleaning chemical called Barsonic.
> 

My family became concerned about the potential health impact of the fumes. We chose to bring this incident to the attention of a fictional retired general at my secondary school. I scheduled an appointment to express our concerns and waited outside the HPE staff room until he exited.

> **General**: I need to use the bathroom.
> 

He entered the L-shaped hallway in the toilet block in the science courtyard.

> **Me**: I’ll wait outside!
> 

My voice echoing off the walls prompted three seventh graders in the stalls to yell random phrases for their amusement.

> **Students**: Wooooo!
**Students**: I'm the best Minecrafter ever!
**Students**: Bananas!
> 

> **General**: *groan* these toilets are absolutely repulsive and covered in grime.
**General**: How much does the school spend to maintain it?
> 

Mrs Itsikson and Mr Broadway, staff members, emerged from the bathroom hallway and I opened the door for them out of courtesy.
