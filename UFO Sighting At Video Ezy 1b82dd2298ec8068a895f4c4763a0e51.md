# Description

During the night I was traveling with my family in my mum’s car to rent films from the Video EZY store at a retail strip down the road. While exiting the side doors, I noticed a rectangular spaceship silently moving down the road above power poles at a steady pace. A square door on the back was open to reveal a sci-fi cream illuminated hallway with a blue rectangular monitor at the end. I felt compelled to walk around the corner of the store to keep watching it move down the road. I called my brother over and asked if he could see it too and he confirmed but shortly afterwards we walked into the store with our parents.

# Interpretations

- Video Ezy: during primary school my family made regular visits to rent movies and PS2 video games.
- Ratchet And Clank 3: references the interior design of the Galactic Rangers dropship.
- It felt so real that during show and tell in preschool, I told everyone that I saw an alien spaceship. One of the children asked what TV show was it from and I said it was real but nobody knew how to respond so I sat down as others continued presenting.
