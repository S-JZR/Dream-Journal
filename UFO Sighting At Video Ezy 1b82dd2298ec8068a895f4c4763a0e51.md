# Description

I was seated in my mum's car with my family being driven by my mum to the Video Ezy store at a retail strip down the road to rent films at night. While exiting the side doors, I noticed a rectangular spaceship silently moving down the road above power poles at a steady pace. A square door on the back was open to reveal a sci-fi cream illuminated hallway with a blue rectangular monitor at the end. I felt compelled to walk around the corner of the store to keep watching it move down the road.

> **Me**: Brother come here.
> 

> **Me**: Do you see it?
> 

> **Brother**: Yeah.
> 

Shortly afterwards we walked into the store with our parents.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - During primary school, my family regularly visited Video Ezy to rent DVDs and PS2 videogames.
    - Since online streaming didn’t exist, you usually only found fragments of TV shows from different physical and online stores.
- Ratchet And Clank 3:
    - The spaceship's interior resembles the Galactic Rangers dropship.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- If you encounter something supernatural then don't do business as usual and document it as you may never experience it again.

# Post Dream

- The dream felt so real that during show and tell in preschool, I told everyone that I saw an alien spaceship. A child asked what TV show it was from and I said it was real but nobody knew how to respond so I sat down as the others continued presenting.
