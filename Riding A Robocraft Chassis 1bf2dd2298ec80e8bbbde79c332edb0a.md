# Description

I was standing in a room with a group of male teenagers who built a flat rectangular blocky white chassis with four monster truck wheels in Robocraft. Initially they drove in on a widescreen TV in a room but it transitioned into being entirely in the real world. We were all seated on it as someone steered across suburban roads with wacky markings. One road had a combination of chevron markings, dotted and solid lines, and a narrow pedestrian strip on the left. Another road had two pedestrian strips in the middle.

To avoid colliding with oncoming traffic, we utilized the extra space in pedestrian strips as a line of cars slowly moved around us. I asked the teenagers how they achieved this and they explained the process involved translating the game footage onto real world footage. I asked if they were referencing pixel changes for context but they said no.
