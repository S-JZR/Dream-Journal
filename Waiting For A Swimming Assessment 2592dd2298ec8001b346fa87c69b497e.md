# Description

I was one of many adults and children waiting beside a large pool to be individually assessed on swimming two laps. Everyone was asked to wait patiently as the process was expected to take two weeks but we could practice in the meantime given we don’t interfere with those being assessed. Throughout the pool were various people floating and practicing, and three large buoyant yellow blankets called islands available to rest on and carry around if necessary. A boy was trying to practice but got stuck halfway across the pool as he bobbed underwater so he frantically raised his hand and yelled at nearby teachers for help who quickly walked over to rescue him.

Eventually, my bladder was full and I didn’t want it to interfere with my performance so I went on a journey past my secondary school classrooms to find a toilet. However, none of them worked until I found a remote one in a small room and closed the horizontal slat blinds to avoid being seen as I did a #1 and #2.

Upon returning, I was called to do the assessment and for each lap I switched between front crawl for the first half to travel faster and backstroke for the second half to conserve energy. I was the best student at the time and everyone cheered me on. Afterwards, a Spanish male student was being assessed and accidentally swam the pool’s width which didn’t count. He did cartwheels to rapidly move across the surface and it was clear he was the most skilled as everyone cheered uncontrollably. He adjusted to try again and beat my record. I was spectating from the side and felt a bit annoyed as I said “there is always someone better in the world”.
