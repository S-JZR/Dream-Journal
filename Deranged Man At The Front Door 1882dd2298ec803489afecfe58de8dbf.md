# Description

I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of my unit when the radio playing music on the shelf to the left of the toilet was interrupted by a distorted voice, prompting me to quickly deactivate it in discomfort. Later, as I descended the stairs to the front door, a groaning, deranged man threw himself against the diamond metal frame, wrapping his fingers around it to press into the flyscreen mesh before collapsing on his side. After calling the police, they arrived to escort him away while he silently stared at me over his shoulder.
