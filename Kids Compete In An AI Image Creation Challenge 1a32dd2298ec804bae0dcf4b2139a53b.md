# Description

A boy and girl sat on the grass beside the pool at my primary school, on opposite sides of a screen, competing to generate the best AI images. They could vote to award a point to themselves, half a point for both, or a point for the opponent. Supervisors tracked the score with numbers written in two sets of green, yellow, and red squares on the ground. The girl hesitated between choosing half or the opponent, believing the answers had to be binary, but the supervisor corrected her.
