# Description

On a grassy area beside my primary school's pool, a boy and a girl sat opposite each other, competing to see who could create the best AI images displayed on a screen beside them. They could vote to award a point to themselves, half a point for both, or a point for the opponent. Supervisors tracked the score with numbers written in two sets of green, yellow, and red squares on the ground. The girl hesitated between choosing half or the opponent, believing the answers had to be binary, but the supervisor corrected her.
