# Description

I entered a forest that opened to reveal a large, steep valley on its right side, illuminated by various scattered lights and buildings. The tranquillity shattered as leaves rustled underfoot, and turning around revealed a werewolf charging at me. In self-defence, I discharged all firearms on hand, making it retreat. However, as I sprinted across a bridge on the left side of the valley, the werewolf resumed its pursuit.

When reaching flat terrain on the other side, green neon lights approached atop the mountains, revealed to be a wave of self-replicating nanobots assimilating anything in their path. Fearing for my life, I descended into the valley to evade the converging threats before climbing up the other side. While navigating through, I overheard a fictional discussion by MatPat about a Rick and Morty episode where Rick carelessly constructs a self-replicating machine for an experiment that seeks to consume matter across all dimensions.

After exiting the forest, I was transported to an almost vacant arcade with cabinets displaying default title sequences. As I reached the opposite side, a single machine exhibited a glitched green screen, prompting me to flee the premises.
