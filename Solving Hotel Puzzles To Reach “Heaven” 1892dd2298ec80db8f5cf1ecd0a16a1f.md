# Description

I was one of five explorers entering a ten-storey spruce hotel lobby with a central atrium and a hutch desk with an open book beside a lounge area with a blue carpet. The pages of the book featured a flowchart with two columns of interlinked sentences enclosed in rectangles, converging into one at the top, though some items were missing with blank spaces. The top-half of a levitating blue translucent plus-size female ghost in elegant attire materialized to greet us. As the missing data in the book temporarily appeared with a flickering glow, she explained how we could reach a place called heaven atop the hotel by solving a series of puzzles but to remain vigilant for a villain intent on trying to sabotage our efforts.

On the middle level, there was an outdoor mountainous area with a lake below, featuring a path of suspended metal bridges with diamond grating, hanging by wire rope from tall structures. Each bridge was separated by small gaps and eventually diverged into two paths around a mountain, the left leading to a plateau and the right coming back at a higher elevation. Opting for the left path, I encountered a large gap with a rectangular piece of sheet metal lying flat above that I leaped under to cross onto land. Another female ghost materialized, offering a hint about the next task. Concerned about falling by hitting my head, I climbed onto the elevated bridge to return.

After completing all objectives, we approached a large rectangular generator on the top floor adorned with three large buttons on the side. As the villain slammed a friend against the balustrade, another swiftly activated the machine, teleporting only us to another small room with a spherical metal mesh in the centre surrounded by tesla coils. Having beaten the antagonist to the end there was no final boss fight and we exited.
