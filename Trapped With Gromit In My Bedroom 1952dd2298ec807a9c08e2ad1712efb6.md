# Description

I was in my brother’s bedroom walking around doing miscellaneous things while a large Gromit zip bag he won in real life from a Wallace In Gromit colouring-in competition was alive and looked around while sitting down. I felt concerned that I was stuck in the dream and didn't know how to escape. All I could do was wait and hope it would end.
