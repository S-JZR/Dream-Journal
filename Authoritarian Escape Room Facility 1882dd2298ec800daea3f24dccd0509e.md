# Description

In a towering concrete facility, prisoners were forced to solve cryptic puzzles in themed escape rooms within five minutes otherwise a mentally unstable mutant monster would be released to kill them. Each monster could also be defeated by discovering their weakness.

I was one of many prisoners wearing orange jumpsuits standing in columns in a waiting area. Rumours spread that a fictional person I knew had achieved the rare feat of defeating a monster by uncovering their weakness and beat them to death over the head with a baseball bat.

The first room resembled a dusty rural outback:

- front:
    - canyon with sci-fi gate
    - red LED sign above the gate displaying cryptic characters
    - opaque windows above LED sign with passing silhouettes of people
- centre:
    - computer terminal with a foundational programming book.

The task entailed deciphering the string and entering it into the terminal to activate the doors. Although permitted to write computer algorithms for assistance, nobody could recall their implementation. This led us to consult a foundational programming book in the room and experiment with code snippets found in it, only to discover that the encryption method was more elaborate than simply rearranging letters. Eerie ambient sounds including muffled arguing, footsteps, and grunts emanated from the walls as the timer neared completion. The outcome is uncertain as the scene abruptly changed.

The second room was identical to my bedroom but with minor differences:

- left:
    - cupboard with drawers in front
- front:
    - bunk bed
- right:
    - 3x3 cube shelving holding one real and eight replica human heads.

The task involved performing a lobotomy on a specific head to activate a button in the brain area. Realizing there were more intricate steps to the puzzle that eluded understanding, I experienced the consequences of failure, seeking refuge with my partner at the back of a deep cupboard with drawers in front. Tension peaked as a tall superhuman, clad in a black dress with grey skin and black eyes, frantically examined the room at an absurd pace before ultimately discovering the hiding spot and lunging at our heads.

I was reunited with my family in a private office featuring a long table and rectangular glass windows fitted with metal bars, one of which was swung open letting in fresh air. A commotion ensued outside as a male inmate obscured from view advised everyone to seize the opportunity to escape by fleeing down the external stairwell. The situation escalated as a guard’s voice erupted in profanity, demanding everyone to immediately halt. While radioing for backup, they stated that Cain class personnel were attempting to escape.
