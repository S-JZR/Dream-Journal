# Description

I was standing in a dimly lit bathroom with a fictional teenage friend as we performed a ritual by:

- Lighting candles.
- Filling a white cast iron bathtub with blood.
- Placing a miniature obelisk on a soap tray on the opposite side of the bathtub.
- Chanting an unknown phrase.

The bloody water bubbled as a female human hand emerged, pulling me closer as a disembodied voice threatened us never to disclose the incident or we would die. After descending back down, my friend and I exchanged startled glances and silently departed the room without speaking.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Freemasonry:
    - References the obelisk and reflection in water that represents “as above, so below”.
    - I’ve heard there is an oath of secrecy with a symbolic death penalty.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Don’t meddle in bad business or you'll invite unnecessary trouble.
