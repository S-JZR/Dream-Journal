# Description

I was in a dimly lit bathroom with flickering candles, participating in a ritual with a fictional teenage friend in front of a white cast iron bathtub filled with blood. A miniature obelisk model stood on a rectangular soap tray atop the opposite end of the bathtub. As we began chanting an unknown phrase the bloody water bubbled as a female human hand emerged, pulling me closer as a disembodied voice threatened us never to disclose the incident or we would die. After descending back down, my friend and I exchanged startled glances and silently departed the room without speaking.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I’ve heard about Freemasonry:
    - The obelisk and reflection in water represents “as above, so below”.
    - There is an oath of secrecy with a symbolic death penalty.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Don’t meddle in bad business or you'll invite unnecessary trouble.
