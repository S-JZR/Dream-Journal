# Description

I was standing in a dimly lit bathroom with a fictional teenage friend as we performed a ritual by:

1. Lighting candles.
2. Filling a white cast iron bathtub with blood.
3. Placing a miniature obelisk on a soap tray on the opposite side of the bathtub.
4. Chanting an unknown phrase.

The bloody water bubbled as a female human hand emerged, grabbed my neck, and pulled me closer. A disembodied female voice threatened us.

> **Female**: Never tell anyone about what you have seen or I will kill you.
> 

After the hand submerged, my friend and I exchanged startled glances and silently departed the room.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Freemasonry:
    - References the obelisk and reflection in water that represents “as above, so below”.
    - I’ve heard that during the initation there is an oath of secrecy with a symbolic death penalty.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Don’t meddle in bad business or you'll invite unnecessary trouble.
