# Description

I was exploring the sewers with my family when we discovered a staircase illuminated by sunlight that led to the city streets. After noticing a parade passing lengthwise through a hall we entered in the side doors and moved towards spectators at front. A middle-age woman turned around and spoke to me.

> **Woman**: This is all a façade.
> 

> **Woman**: We're being paid to stand at the front to make it look busier.
> 

> **Woman**: If you go to the reception desk and fill out your details, they will mail you a cheque.
