# Description

I was exploring the sewers with my family when we discovered a staircase illuminated by sunlight that led to the city streets. After noticing a parade passing lengthwise through a hall we entered in the side doors and moved towards people at front of the line. A middle-age woman turned to me and said “this is all a façade since we're being paid to stand at the front to make it look busier and if you go to the reception desk to fill out your details they'll mail you a cheque”.
