# Description

I was standing on the grass to the left of my garage, watching two girls and one boy engaged in imaginative play, trying to build an empire by laying down a line of bricks. They played for hours until night fell but the boy couldn’t take it anymore due to being unbearably boring. In frustration, he picked up a brick and walked over to my neighbour’s adjacent garage to throw it at the window despite our pleas for him to stop. However, it didn’t break to everyone’s surprise so he threw it two more times with the same result.

Eventually, his parents parked beside the footpath to pick him up and without hesitation he ran over to be driven away. While looking at the small dints in the glass I said to the girls that they must have used bullet proof glass. I also admitted that even I found the activity boring and suggested that we could have used the same time to learn about things like STEM and contraptions.
