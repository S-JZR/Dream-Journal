# Description

I was in an RTS videogame loosely resembling The Conquerors 3, where four players were in courthouses with shallow staircase, all facing each other in a square area. Inside each building was a square pool of water that killed on contact, surrounded by two paths that led into side mazes. A trail of levitating candy would periodically spawn on the paths which players could collect and return to the centre of their base for money. There were two types of red glowing NPC enemies that killed on contact:

- Standard: randomly followed predefined paths.
- Slime: slowly hopped towards me.

At the start of the round, I quickly built a giant destroyer and drove it across land to an enemy base where I fired a stream of 2 bullets from the hull to annihilate all their buildings. However, they kept trying to rebuild a barracks so I felt bad and left.

Eventually, someone was standing at the front entrance of my base entrance. I transformed into the Bowler Hat Guy from Meet The Robinsons and suggested to Doris that she should carry me to the roof but I settled for checking for a ladder on the left side. However, it didn’t lead to the roof and sat in the entrance of an L-shaped hallway with a side toilet and bathroom, featuring containers behind the doors.
