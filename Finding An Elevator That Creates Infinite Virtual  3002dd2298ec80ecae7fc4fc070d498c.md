# Description

I walked beside the entrance of an indoor café and noticed a popular elevator upstairs that opened portals to different virtual worlds that were seemingly infinite in size. Some worlds featured NPCs that looked and behaved like real people. There was only an open door and speaker button with two modes including:

- Randomly generating a world with no prompt.
- Generating a specific world with a prompt.

People were constantly exiting the elevator and queuing to enter. I saw various people enter worlds including:

- A library with bookshelves and rows of computers to the sides.
- Volcanic terrain with mushrooms.

I overheard others talking as they exited.

> **People**: The worlds are so immersive, you could feel and be moved by everything you interact with.

I had a few concerns including whether:

- Entering the portal could alter my DNA.
- Moving objects could kill me.

Despite my fears, I chose to give it a try when it was my turn and entered a randomly generated shopping mall hub in the afternoon when most stores were shut and various NPCs roamed. After travelling through a long hallway to the right and reaching city streets, I was worried about losing the elevator and being trapped in the world so I returned to exit.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- The Elevator:
    - Likely references random scenarios being revealed when the elevator doors open.
- Genie 3**:**
    - Likely references generating infinite interactive AI worlds which was showcased last year: [https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/).
