# Description

I walked beside the entrance of an indoor café and noticed there was a popular attraction upstairs of an elevator that opened portals to different virtual worlds that were seemingly infinite in size. Some worlds had NPCs that looked and behaved like real people. The elevator featured an open door and speaker button with two modes including:

- Not setting a prompt and opening the door to randomly generate a world.
- Setting a prompt and opening the door to generate a specific world.

People were constantly leaving and queuing outside the elevator. I saw various people enter worlds including:

- A library with bookshelves and rows of computers to the sides.
- Volcanic terrain with mushrooms.

I overheard others saying that the worlds were immersive and you could feel and be moved by everything you interacted with but I was worried that you could be killed by moving objects.

When seeing the portal for the first time, I was worried that entering it would cause unforeseen health problems like altering my DNA but I chose to give it a try anyway.

When it was my turn I didn’t set a prompt and entered a randomly generated shopping mall hub with most stores shut during the afternoon as various NPCs walked around. I noticed a waypoint sign on the ceiling to the right hallway that pointed towards the exit and followed it. I travelled for a long time through the hallway until exiting outside into a city but I was worried about forgetting where the elevator was and being trapped in the world so I returned to exit.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- The Elevator:
    - Likely references random scenarios being revealed when the elevator doors open.
- Genie 3**:**
    - Likely references generating infinite interactive AI worlds which was showcased last year: [https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/).
