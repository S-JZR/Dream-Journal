# Description

I was standing with my family in a room on the top floor of a refurbished yellow stone heritage building with columns on the outside that was turned into apartments. We realized there were some shortcomings including the space was one giant room without walls and the elevator didn’t reach the top floor. I used a tape measure and placed objects on the floor to plan where the balcony would be.

We exited the building and met with a nearby woman working for the city council to complain.

> **Mum**: Is it possible to have builders adds walls in our room and extend the elevator to the top floor?
> 

> **Woman**: You would need to contact the city council about that.
> 

> **Woman**: It probably won’t be possible since it would damage the building.
> 

I considered that the building could have a joint ownership between a private organization and the city council which could further complicate matters.
