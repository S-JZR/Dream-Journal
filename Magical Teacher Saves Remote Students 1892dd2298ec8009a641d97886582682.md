# Description

I was standing in a rural bushland and followed a dirt path towards a distant primary school atop a tall hill. Upon arriving, a man outside watched me create portals and asked how it was possible. I explained that I recited a four-word African chant and slammed the ground with a wooden staff to create entrances and exits. Once inside, a strict teacher, who was also the accountant, kept scolding the children for making mistakes. For some reason, after being able to read a document of the school's financial history left on a table, I claimed to know how to do the job better and save thousands of dollars. After clarifying that I could travel to the location on time using portals, a vote was held among all present parents and staff who elected me as the new teacher. Eventually, food supplies were unexpectedly disrupted, prompting everyone to discuss how to resolve the issue before most joined another group, with a few following me. I recall saying something regarding a previous lesson about the strict teacher that "these are the kinds of people you should avoid and adhering their advice will lead to consequences."

My group made a shelter in a small cave in the forest and covered the entrance with black flannel boards to conceal light from the fire inside. While searching for supplies, a wild animal startled us, causing everyone to scatter and try returning to safety. At the cave, a child began calling out from afar, so I answered back and move closer until presumably finding them. Eventually, we discovered an abandoned white commuter plane on a distant runway as everyone boarded it to travel into an urban location.

Various glass bottles and appliances were stored in the rear as a few issues unfolded. Medicine and alcohol bottles were accidentally mixed because of their nearly identical appearance, featuring brown glass and white labelling, with the only distinction being the varying lip diameters of 5mm and 1.5cm. Consequently, we manually organized them into two groups. Jodie Whittaker from Doctor Who remarked on noticing pressure cookers spontaneously combusting in the rear, prompting me to lift the boxes as they fell through the bottom and use a fire extinguisher to extinguish them.
