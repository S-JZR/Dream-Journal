# Description

I was traveling across a levitating obstacle course made of cubes, with a black cat by my side hopping over everything, heading toward an airport in the distance. Upon entering, I noticed it had an eerie dark grey metallic interior with a few people sitting on benches and walking around. I took the cat to a two metre wide veterinary clinic built into a wall. The male vet was a corrupt conman, working with five nurses to treat fake illnesses for profit.

As staff covered the entrance with a fold-out Shoji screen, they placed the cat onto an operating table, and bright lights cast silhouettes of everything in the room. They shaved off all its fur except for a small hairdo on its head and amputated its back legs to replace them with prosthetics. Throughout the entire procedure, I stood waiting outside the store. When receiving the black cat back, I was horrified by what they did and exclaimed how they amputated its back legs which caused nearby bystanders to express concern. I immediately went into the store to complain, but the vet dismissed me, saying all purchases were final. He also claimed to be late for a flight on his personal jet, as a fake plane outside the window, with a metal skeleton encased in a series of large metal rings, moved toward a passenger boarding bridge.

The vet ascended a nearly pitch-black stairwell to enter a side office filled with various scientific equipment. A few people followed me upstairs behind him and a woman helped me film the entire incident as evidence. It quickly became clear that he was a bit insane. He frantically rushed around preparing for the flight and exited his office twice to approach us with what looked like a thin plastic tube before returning. We weren't sure it was a knife so we backed away. He claimed to have heard a bomb ticking and opened a deep metal container to the right of a room, urging us to listen to a quiet rhythmic beat, which I instinctively knew was meant to be the hearts of animals he had torn out. Wanting to get a confession, I opted to play the role of a bad cop. I pressured him about knowing what he had in those containers, what he had been doing to animals, and called him a series of derogatory terms like animal abuser, corrupt, heartless, deranged, conman, and a disgusting creature on the planet. He collapsed onto the floor distraught and eventually confessed to abusing animals. We called the police and got him arrested with the botched cat and recorded confession as evidence.
