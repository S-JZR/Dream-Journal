# Description

I was one of many contestants on a MrBeast gameshow competing in a series of challenges to win $5 million but I was progressing by sheer luck. While being filmed, I felt nervous about making a mistake or doing something that would make me seem foolish so I remained quiet out of shyness.

In one challenge, everyone moved into a theatre and had to throw balls at the stage to knockdown small planes printed on thin wooden boards attached to a stick, moving behind a wooden board with a painted sky backdrop. Each plane could only be claimed by one player. After everyone thought all the planes had been hit they mingled on the stage talking to each other. However, one appeared later and stopped in the middle of the stage in front of someone. Nobody noticed it so I walked up and tapped it with the ball in my hand to secure my place as a winner.

After more challenges I was one of the last two players remaining in a large dark room when Mr Beast asked us to share with each other why we thought we deserved the prize. A middle-aged female opponent explained her desire to start a clinic to fight cancer. I concluded that a bold and fair approach was necessary, given her determination and the fact that we both wanted something. I chose not to share my story, as it might expose my weakness and make her doubt my worthiness, and instead directly propose splitting the prize or offer her a disproportionately larger share. While saying this, I extended my hand for a handshake to pressure her with a sense of finality and she agreed.
