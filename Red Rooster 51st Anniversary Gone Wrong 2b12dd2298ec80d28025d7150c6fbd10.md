# Description

I was seated in my mum’s car with my family being driven by my mum across the country to a remote southern style Red Rooster. We walked inside to the self-serve machine featuring a ridiculous amount of food items like candy, vegetables, chicken, drinks, etc.

A family of three was angry about something and left.

> **Man**: We're never coming back here again!
> 

After ordering, a female Asian staff member emerged.

> **Woman**: Hello everyone!
> 

> **Woman**: It's the store’s 51st anniversary today!
> 

> **Woman**: I would like to invite everyone to stand together for a group photo and I will post it on social media.
> 

Most customers gathered together but the Wi-Fi dropped out.

> **Woman**: I apologise but the Wi-Fi has dropped out so I can't post it.
