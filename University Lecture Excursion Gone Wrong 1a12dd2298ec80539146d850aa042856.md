# Description

I was one of many secondary school students on an art excursion to a university lecture. We entered a chicken house through the back in a line:

- Front:
    - Exit.
- Left:
    - Exit.
    - Stables.
- Right:
    - Exit.
- Back:
    - L-shaped hallway with an exit.
- Floor:
    - Scattered hay and seeds.

Suddenly, a swarm of yellow chicks emerged from the back and rushed past my feet. To avoid accidentally stepping on them, I shuffled my feet back and forth, creating a trail as I moved toward the doorway ahead. A few students who took notice mocked me for refusing to walk normally and falling behind. There was a paved walkway outside, beside a row of buildings, that gradually ascended with periodic step and was covered in eggs scattered around. I continued shuffling with controlled force to make them roll away without flinging them into hard surfaces. A few eggs were stood on by others with crumpled shells that revealed bloody areas inside.

After arriving at a university auditorium and taking a seat, a few student volunteers hosted a lecture on designing a good narrative plot. However, the presentation was a mediocre PowerPoint lasting for one minute that showcased the premise of a Sci-Fi story with text on images but lacked any explanation of the creative process behind it. Halfway through, Mrs Brown, my art teacher, sitting a few seats to my left, audibly mentioned how she liked the idea. At the end, only a few people clapped apathetically which was barely audible. They opened another presentation and explained that after lunch they were going to discuss how to design a video game with a theme set in China. The slides were still loading and completely blank so the lead speaker made a cheap gag that perhaps it was made there as the audience responded with reluctant amusement.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I often feel like university is a waste of time as lectures and workshops, among other things, tend to be mediocre.
- The time spend to attend university in-person feels unjustified given its educational value.

## Symbols

- Shuffling feet: the desire to avoid harming animals and insects.
- Mrs Brown: the feeling that people don’t challenge university enough or emphasize the wrong things as they accept everything that is handed to them.

## Lessons

- N/A.
