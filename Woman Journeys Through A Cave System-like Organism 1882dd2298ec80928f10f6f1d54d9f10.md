# Description

The dream resembled an 8-bit 2D platformer video game.

A female explorer travelled right through a grey cave system-like organism. Eventually, she reached a T-junction where the passage curved upward and downward in a C-shape. The disembodied voice of a female narrator said something like she decided to travel towards the brain. As she ascended the path, everything slowly faded to white, prompting me to jolt awake in unease.
