# Description

I was driving to a Christian meeting when I tuned in the radio and heard a male commentator.

> **Commentator**: All religions are silly relics fading away but get this somehow Gen Z is more open to marriage than casual sex.
> 

Upon arriving, two long rows of white fold-out tables stood outside on a grassy field separated by a gap with various Christian participants seated on white stackable plastic chairs around the entire perimeter as I sat at the small side. Different people voiced their concerns over a microphone like a bald bearded man.

> **Man**: Attendance at my church is declining.
**Man**: If this continues our faith might cease to exist in the future.
**Man**: (Sarcasm) Do we need to increase sensory experiences like music to attract more participants?
> 

I thought to myself that these people lacked direction because they:

- Don’t have a coherent grand strategy.
- Prioritize aesthetics over the underlying message.
- Invest in expanding buildings that benefit a few over online resources that benefit the world.
- Don’t collaborate to produce teaching resources.
- Deliver long inefficient sermons, particularly videos, that make key points hard to extract.
- Don’t have one unifying body of knowledge and each denominations has different perspectives.
- Don’t document or critically examine denominational differences.
- Unaware of postmodern, etc criticisms of the faith and don’t challenge them. Christians often assume everyone supports God’s actions without justification.

A fat middle-age female host stood at the centre trying to inspire everyone.

> **Woman**: We desperately need to do things better.
> 

I thought to myself what does she mean by "better"? Does she have a specific goal in mind or is she merely using vague exhortations to hype people up without a concrete plan and actionable steps to bring change?
