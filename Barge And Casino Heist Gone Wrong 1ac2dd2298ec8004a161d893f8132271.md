# Description

I was with a group of people on a ferry exiting a channel at night when we dismounted into a yellow inflatable raft to rob a rectangular barge featuring two levels and a flat shallow back with chained linked fences. After rowing toward it and colliding with the back, we peered through gaps in horizontal wooden rectangular boards to observe a male guard constantly scanning the surroundings. Each of us snuck past when he wasn't looking. Everyone independently explored the interior to find loot, including credit cards belonging to billionaires and a heavy chest. After jumping back into the raft, we rowed back toward the ferry but travelled faster than expected, realizing we had left the treasure behind due to lacking coordination. When those on the barge noticed the missing items, they rotated it to pursue us. We figured the ferry would take too long to start up, so we kept using the raft.

We considered where to withdraw a large sum of money using the credit cards and settled on a nearby casino, knowing it had many ATMs. Upon arriving, we parked outside the entrance in the porte cochere for a quick getaway and entered a small room lined with ATMs on both sides. However, when swiping the cards at every ATM, the screens displayed red and white error messages, indicating the cards were stolen, and alarm bells rang over each other. As security guards approached to investigate, we fled back to the car, hearing police sirens closing in as they parked behind us. In a panic, we sped down a series of roads while being chased. Eventually, we hit a ramp to become airborne and got stuck behind a rectangular fast food sign on a pole hidden from view as police drove past.
