# Description

Three women near a subway exit were abducted by an insane man who took them back to his home to perform forced labour. Many individuals in a 4-kilometre radius in the suburb were complicit in the crime syndicate, ensuring prisoners remained captive by reporting on any escape attempts via radios. Initially, the women were permitted to roam the house, but failing to fulfil duties or attempts to escape would result in severe punishments.

During their first escape attempt, while hiding behind trees along the path of a nearby park at night, they were spotted by a stranger peering out from the upstairs window of their home with binoculars. Subsequently, they were captured and punished by having their breasts sewn by folding over themselves.

Eventually, they discovered a mysterious book of knowledge in the attic, presumably left behind by a previous survivor, detailing various escape methods from the zone. After reading about a treehouse exhibit in a mall, they fled there to climb inside and escaped the neighbourhood when those searching for them moved to another location.
