# Description

Working alongside a team of police officers, we encountered a difficult situation where an aggressive gang obstructed access to the vehicle. Tensions heightened as they taunted and pursued us, forcing us to discharge our pistols in self-defence.

During a formal indoor event at a carnival, children were led to a side room for a separate performance by women wearing revealing clothing.

While revisiting my church, Springwood House of Praise, various tables of food spanned the bottom and top floor. In the upstairs children's room, adorned with festive Christmas décor, people gathered on white monobloc plastic chairs between two tables of iced biscuits. Eventually, I began delivering a heartfelt sermon to everyone in the room, urging against conformity to the world and succumbing to fleeting carnal desires. Without dismissing the emotions stirred by these desires, individuals often find themselves compelled to follow their every command, succumbing to animalistic behaviours devoid of moral understanding and struggling to exhibit self-control. Society often perceives believers as unconventional for refusing to embrace addictions, as they remain captivated by meaningless temporary carnal pleasures that lack creative substance. Conversely, those steadfast in the spirit focus on the eternal and discipline themselves to achieve higher standards that consistently contribute value to their communities.
