# Description

I was one of many police officers walking back to our police cars when we encountered a hostile gang, equipped with bats and knives, blocking them. As they taunted us and charged forward, we were forced to shoot them in self-defence.

During a formal indoor event at a carnival, children were led to a side room for a separate performance by women wearing revealing clothing.

While revisiting the Springwood House of Praise church various tables of food spanned the bottom and top floor. In the upstairs children's room, adorned with festive Christmas décor, people gathered on white monobloc plastic chairs between two tables of iced biscuits. Eventually, I began delivering a heartfelt sermon to everyone in the room, urging against conformity to the world and succumbing to fleeting carnal desires. Without dismissing the emotions stirred by these desires, individuals often find themselves compelled to follow their every command, succumbing to animalistic behaviours devoid of moral understanding and struggling to exhibit self-control. Society often perceives believers as unconventional for refusing to embrace addictions, as they remain captivated by meaningless temporary carnal pleasures that lack creative substance. Conversely, those steadfast in the spirit focus on the eternal and discipline themselves to achieve higher standards that consistently contribute value to their communities.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Online Videos:
    - I have encountered and reported YouTube and Internet Archive accounts mixing porn videos with children’s cartoon videos.
    - Some ASMR creators share SFW content on YouTube and sell NSFW content on external websites to adhere community guidelines. They create topics that can appeal to broad audiences but also subtly advertise it in some way to get customers like:
        - Hidden offsite links.
        - Suggestive thumbnails without content in the video.
        - Wearing suggestive clothing.
        - Having sexual undertones to intimate gestures.
        - Incorporating soft BDSM like mommy doms and praise.

## Symbols

- Gang:
    - Rebellion against authority and the law.
- Suggestive Women:
    - Content made to seem innocent and caring but with a hidden sexual agenda.
- Sermon:
    - Feeling like people mindlessly waste their time on distractions and vain things.

## Lessons

- We live in a fallen world so stay vigilant and disciplined.
