# Description

I was standing in the upstairs room of a random house with many fictional children and a middle-aged woman when a Zorgon spaceship from Zathura flew past the window and revealed cannons primed to fire. We quickly huddled into the dumbwaiter and slowly descended into the basement to avoid being harmed.

> **Woman**: Quick, get to the dumbwaiter!
> 

We exited into an office room with a VHS player and tapes on the desk.

> **Me**: It's been a long time since I've used one of these.
> 

I inserted a tape which showed pre-recorded CCTV footage of the hallway outside the room, resembling something from Monsterum, where a green monster roamed and a male narrator spoke.

> **Man**: To whoever finds this tape, I must warn you about imminent dangers within the facility.
> 

> **Me**: Various creatures have broken in and are periodically roaming hallways and rooms.
> 

> **Man**: You will be need to keep track of them and navigate stealthily to stay safe.
> 

I travelled through the hallway to a downstairs room with an air vent but it started rumbling as a male ogre slowly crawled through it. I forced him to divert by pulling a lever to the right of the vent which lowered a metal sheet in front of it.

> **Ogre**: You've got to be f***ing kidding me!
> 

Since only one vent could be closed at a time in the area, I released it and warmed my brother upstairs via a walkie talkie that the ogre was climbing vertically to his floor.
