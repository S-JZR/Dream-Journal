# Description

During Christmas week, my family explored festive attractions along a riverside promenade beside a cantilever bridge with a concrete base.

I was walking towards Santa, Mrs. Claus, and elves at a sleigh with Aleksandr and Sergei from Compare The Market. Mr. Claus gave us presents, including paintings for Aleksandr and Sergei and a large bottle of wine for me.

> **Me**: (joking) Does the NSA work for Santa?
> 

Mrs Clause looked shocked and an Elf intervened.

> **Elf**: That’s classified information!
> 

I continued walking with my family until we encountered an inappropriate life-size statue of Sullivan from Monsters Inc., featuring a mailbox flap at the crotch. A curious girl opened it and turned to her parents.

> **Girl**: Why is it being removed?
> 

We walked past a group of men, secretly part of a criminal organization, playing cricket on a platform over the ocean beside a harbour. The bowler stood on a high central pillar, pitching balls sharply downward to players on lower pillars in a ring. Nearby boats travelling opposite directions collided, startling the bowler who released the ball prematurely, which landed on the footpath. He turned around.

> **Bowler**: (To me) Give it back!
> 

I resentfully pegged it at him, knocking him into the water and gave a salute.

> **Me**: Adios.
> 

They shouted profusely, rushing to ladders and boats to chase me.

> **Me**: (To parents) Meet me later.
> 

I fled to the bridge as a few ascended below. Upon reaching the opposite side, a katana materialized in my hand, and I impulsively stabbed an innocent man emerging around a wall. As I entered a staff area at a restaurant, I impulsively impaled a waiter while ascending L-shaped stairs to an office with a rectangular window overlooking the dining area. Gusts from ceiling fans shifted the blinds as a secondary school student seated below saw me.

> **Student**: He’s up there!
> 

I dashed outside, discovering another bridge leading to a yellow oil rig. Upon arriving, I urgently searched for a way to escape into the ocean. As people breached the complex, they fought with workers and bumped a power box, causing two curved vents on the roof to spark and shut down. Seizing the opportunity, I climbed into the vents to descend past the deactivated blades as an employee stood beside the opening with a sadistic grin.

> **Employee**: If you go any further I’ll turn the fans back on.
> 

I quickly climbed out in shock. The platform soon tilted over the sidewalk from fierce waves, so I slid off to run away.

Determined to uncover the culprits behind the criminal organization, I ventured into a rundown part of the city to discover an abandoned warehouse constructed from red bricks. Two gangs entered, and I picked the lock to observe the drug deal. After sniping both middlemen, I retreated into the inner city. In the town square, a gunshot narrowly missed my forehead, and I spotted a distant figure in black attire behind me amid a crowd. I dove behind the retaining wall of a hedgerow and darted around the block. While entering a sports club with a wooden interior, I ascended a staircase, looking for assassins from higher windows as the owner approached from behind.

> **Owner**: Is everything alright?
**Me**: [Relaying the situation]
**Me**: Can I hide here?
**Owner**: Follow me to the roof.
> 

The owner led me to a flying blue mini-submarine spaceship on the roof with a translucent front and windows on the top, sides, and bottom. We entered inside and he drove it into the sky.

> **Owner**: Cover yourself with that cardboard box on the floor and use the periscope to observe the surroundings.
> 

Eventually, we glided past a hovering 3D semi-circle quartz structure, revealed as the gang's headquarters. The entire bottom was an aquarium with a window on the front face and a curved ancient Greek-style house with pillars built on top at the back edge.

> **Me**: Can you land on it so I can put a stop to all of this.
**Owner**: No it’s too heavily defended.
**Owner**: We need to find another location where they will be exposed.
**Me**: We can go to an abandoned warehouse where they met up earlier.
> 

We landed beside the warehouse and my family was already outside as a few people roamed around. As I examined the side entrance for a weak door to infiltrate, I found them bolted shut, making it impossible to open without making a noise. People nearby exchanged money for sealed bags of white powder through a hole in the wall. Retreating to a wooden bridge over a pond in the centre of the road with a stranger standing nearby.

> **Stranger**: What is that gun for?
**Me**: It’s for dealing with criminals.
**Me**: I could shoot them all but I won’t because I’m not evil.
> 

Unexpectedly, numerous senior military officers, wearing green uniforms adorned with medals, cheerfully escorted my parents away.
