# Description

During Christmas week, my family explored festive attractions along a riverside promenade beside a cantilever bridge with a concrete base.

The Compare The Market meerkat mascots and I approached Santa, Mrs. Claus, and elves at a sleigh. Mr. Claus gave us presents, including paintings for the meerkats and a large bottle of wine for me. I jokingly asked if the NSA worked for Santa, which shocked Mrs. Clause, prompting an Elf to intervene and explain it was confidential.

I continued walking with my family until we encountered an inappropriate life-size statue of Sullivan from Monsters Inc., featuring a mailbox flap at the crotch. A curious child opened it and asked their parents why it was being decommissioned.

We walked past a group of men, secretly part of a criminal organization, playing cricket on a platform over the ocean beside a harbour. The bowler stood on a high central pillar, pitching balls sharply downward to players on lower pillars in a ring. Nearby boats travelling opposite directions collided, startling the bowler who released the ball prematurely, which landed on the footpath. He turned around and antagonistically demanded it back. I resentfully pegged it at him, knocking him into the water while shouting "adios" with a salute. They shouted profusely, rushing to ladders and boats to chase me. I instructed my family to meet me later and fled to the bridge as a few ascended below. Upon reaching the opposite side, a katana materialized in my hand, and I impulsively stabbed an innocent man emerging around a wall. As I entered a staff area at a restaurant, I impulsively impaled a waiter while ascending L-shaped stairs to an office with a rectangular window overlooking the dining area. Gusts from ceiling fans shifted the blinds, prompting a former high school student downstairs to announce my location. I dashed outside, discovering another bridge leading to a yellow oil rig. Upon arriving, I urgently searched for a way to escape into the ocean. As people breached the complex, they fought with workers and bumped a power box, causing two curved vents on the roof to spark and shut down. Seizing the opportunity, I climbed into the vents to descend past the deactivated blades. An employee near the opening with a sadistic grin threatened to activate the fans if I proceeded, so I quickly climbed out in shock. The platform soon tilted over the sidewalk from fierce waves, so I slid off to run away.

Determined to uncover the culprits behind the criminal organization, I ventured into a rundown part of the city to discover an abandoned warehouse constructed from red bricks. Two gangs entered, and I picked the lock to observe the drug deal. After sniping both middlemen, I retreated into the inner city. In the town square, a gunshot narrowly missed my forehead, and I spotted a distant figure in black attire behind me amid a crowd. I dove behind the retaining wall of a hedgerow and darted around the block. While entering a sports club with a wooden interior, I ascended a staircase, looking for assassins from higher windows. A family of three trailed behind, but the top railing was loose, and a girl leaning against it plummeted to the ground floor, but she was unharmed. I informed the store owner of my emergency, and he led me to a flying blue mini-submarine spaceship atop the store with a translucent front and windows on the top, sides, and bottom. As we levitated into the sky, he instructed me to cover myself with a cardboard box on the floor and use the periscope to observe the surroundings. Eventually, we glided past a hovering 3D semi-circle quartz structure, revealed as the gang's headquarters. The entire bottom was an aquarium with a window on the front face and a curved ancient Greek-style house with pillars built on top at the back edge. I suggested landing there to put a stop to it all. However, he refused, explaining that it was too heavily defended and that we needed to find another location where they would be exposed. I proposed heading to the abandoned warehouse from earlier instead.

My family was already at the warehouse as a few people roamed around. As I examined the side entrance for a weak door to infiltrate, I found them bolted shut, making it impossible to open without making a noise. People nearby exchanged money for sealed bags of white powder through a hole in the wall. Retreating to a wooden bridge over a pond in the centre of the road, a stranger asked about the firearm I was holding. I explained that it was for dealing with criminals and that although I could shoot all of them, I won't because I'm not evil. Unexpectedly, numerous senior military officers, wearing green uniforms adorned with medals, cheerfully escorted my parents away.
