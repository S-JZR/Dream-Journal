# Description

I was at home and decided to get nostalgic by emulating one of my favourite video games, Road Trip Adventure, on PC with a save file. While exploring the world, I found various candid screenshots on my computer showing the locations of secret treasure chests in different terrain. However, I realized my childhood efforts were a waste of time as it lacked spatial context and would have been better documented on something like a Fandom map, allowing everyone to easily find each point.

After digging through the code, I toggled different developer flags that unlocked all buildings in My City. I reflected on how:

- Progress in video games is an arbitrary construct.
- Investing excessive time to achieve everything is unproductive, especially as modern games get longer or if the platforms eventually shutdown and all data is lost.
- One could easily modify the code, execute commands to obtain any item, or watch others’ gameplay online who achieve everything.
- Players are merely agreeing to engage in an adventure predefined by developers and being confined to its available choices and rules for the thrill of growth, strategy, and seeing a narrative unfold.
- Everyone should only take what they need and move on.
- Any undocumented experience will be forgotten anyway.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Road Trip Adventures featured Quick-Pic Shops everywhere not treasure chests.
- I used to to take candid photos of computer monitors and TVs using a handheld camera as a child because I didn’t know how to take screenshots or record them directly.
- I’ve grown to dislike videogames because I feel like they’re wasting our time and preventing us from developing real world skills.
- I’ve been working on Fandom wikis recently and considered the most efficient way to express information.

## Symbols

- Gameplay: nostalgia.

## Lessons

- Videogames are arbitrary constructs so be careful how much time you spend on them.
- Undocumented experiences are forgotten.
