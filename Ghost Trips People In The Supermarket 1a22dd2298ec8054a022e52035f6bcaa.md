# Description

I was browsing in a supermarket when people in the frozen food section constantly slipped and hit their heads on the floor when walking past a wet floor sign. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the ground was dry. As I continued shopping beside chest freezers, wary of others nearby, invisible fingers tugged my legs backwards, making me instinctively extend my arms as I fell. After standing up, I swiftly turned around and attempted to spot the culprit, but the aisle was empty. A concerned bystander approached, asking about the incident, so I recalled the experience, and their cheerful expression turned serious.
