# Description

I was walking on the footpath outside the drop-off zone fence of my secondary school when a depraved white dog placed an unconscious cat with a ticking timebomb in its chest in front of a car parked at the exit. It called out to me, demanding that I get in and drive over it. Rejecting this request, I retreated to the street on the other side of the road as the dog began following closely behind, growling menacingly. In desperation, I pulled out a pistol and fired multiple shots at its head, but to no effect, causing me to flee in terror.
