# Description

While walking outside the footpath beside the fence of my secondary school, a depraved white dog placed an unconscious cat with an embedded ticking timebomb in front of a car tyre parked outside the drop-off zone exit. It called out to me, demanding that I get in and drive over it. Rejecting this request, I retreated to the street on the other side of the road as the dog began following closely behind, growling menacingly. In desperation, I pulled out a pistol and fired multiple shots at its head, but to no effect, causing me to flee in terror.
