# Description

I was roaming my neighbourhood with three fictional friends as we passed the time by peeking through garage windows to find anything interesting but to no avail. We returned to the road, where a clean-up crew was sweeping with a machine resembling a fan with brushes for blades.

As we neared my unit complex, it transformed into a road leading to an unfamiliar church covered by a thin layer of ice. We decided to slide across it, but my lack of skill caused me to repeatedly lose balance. When we arrived, I narrowly avoided colliding with a hot water urn on a folding table, and a nearby woman pointed out how close the encounter had been.
