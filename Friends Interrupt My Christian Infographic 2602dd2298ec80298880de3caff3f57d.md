# Description

I was seated at my desk in my unit working on drawing a high level plan of a bible infographic to efficiently showcase events, themes, and insights like:

- The three realms: heaven is light, earth is half light and darkness, and hell is darkness.
- A third of the angels rebelled and fell from heaven.
- The fall: Satan is the ancient serpent.
- God always provides a way for salvation.

However, I barely made any progress when I was notified that a group of male and female fictional friends dressed in tuxedos and dresses were coming over and wanted to go out with me to somewhere for fun so I got dressed.

As night fell, we stood in my backyard bored doing nothing when a young naïve woman tried to lighten the mood by doing the hokey pokey. I thought it was immature and foolish so I immediately started walking inside. She became upset and asked if I had any better ideas. I suggested we could at least watch a movie at a theatre to salvage the time we had left and asked if anyone knew what was on or thought anything was interesting. My mother sitting on the couch in the lounge room overhead the conversation and yelled that we could just watch a movie at home for free and don’t need to waste money which annoyed me.
