# Description

I was one of many soldiers crossing a mostly flat grassy field towards a forest when distant enemy gunfire erupted, prompting everyone to sprint forward and drop into a prone position behind small dirt mounds. Incoming bullets struck the ground nearby, kicking up puffs of dust into the air as I feared being shot in the head.

I couldn't believe that God allowed our lives to be like this and I was forced to fight in combat. Our commander ordered everyone to aim their muskets at a wave of calvary charging out of the trees 100 metres ahead and fire a volley but most shots seemed to miss as they continued to gallop passed us.
