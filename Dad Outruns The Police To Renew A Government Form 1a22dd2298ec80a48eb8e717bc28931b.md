# Description

I was seated in my dad's car with my family being driven by my dad to a government office to update his form. While speeding at 300 km/h in a rural area, weaving between cars, a police officer stationed beside a dirt path leading into a forest unexpectedly activated their sirens and began to pursue us. However, they quickly lost track of him as he outpaced them, entering the city before decelerating to navigate various streets and eventually stopping in the parking lot outside the government office. Everyone entered the building as my dad approached the right side of a small dark brown wooden counter, where a woman served him by placing a blank version of his green form beside the current one and instructing him to fill it out.

My brother sat at the back, while my mother and I went to the left side of the counter, where the same woman served us again. She said we didn’t need to be up there unless we were family. I replied that we were, but she struggled to clarify what she meant until she used an analogy, implying she only wanted to serve everyone individually as we walked back to sit down.
