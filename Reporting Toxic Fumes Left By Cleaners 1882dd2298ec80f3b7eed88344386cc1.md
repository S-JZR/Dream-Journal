# Description

I was seated with my family in my mum's car being driven by my mum to a veterans resort to meet someone. We noticed two connected tennis ball courts beside the complex when we pulled into the parking lot and decided to play a game. However, before entering, a cleaning crew suddenly brought in their equipment to wash the floors, and a ride-on floor scrubber leaked a small white puddle near the entrance. When inquiring about the substance, they explained it was a toxic cleaning chemical called Barsonic. My family became concerned about the potential health impact of the fumes.

We chose to bring this incident to the attention of a fictional retired general at my secondary school. I scheduled an appointment to express concerns as he exited the HPE staff room. Unexpectedly, he requested to use the restroom before advancing through the adjacent science courtyard into the L-shaped hallway of the toilet block. Having no intention of entering, I shouted from the entrance that I would wait outside. As my voice echoed within, a couple of seventh graders in the stalls promptly followed suit by exclaiming random phrases for their amusement. Simultaneously, the general groaned about the unsanitary conditions of the restroom and rhetorically questioned how much the school spends to maintain it. Mrs Itsikson and Mr Broadway, staff members, emerged from the bathroom hallway and I opened the door for them out of courtesy.
