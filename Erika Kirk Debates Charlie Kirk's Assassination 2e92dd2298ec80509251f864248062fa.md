# Description

I was standing in a building with Erika Kirk and various left wing adults seated on black metal cushioned chairs facing each other as they debated Charlie Kirk’s assassination.

> **Erika Kirk**: If you oppose violence then why are you encouraging his death?
> 

> **Erika Kirk**: Should I be concerned?
> 

> **Erika Kirk**: Are you also going to target my family and hate me for having a different view from yours?
> 

A tubby woman wearing a black T-shirt with black hair and purple highlights spoke up.

> **Woman**: No, we don’t hate you ... we just don’t want you to breed.
