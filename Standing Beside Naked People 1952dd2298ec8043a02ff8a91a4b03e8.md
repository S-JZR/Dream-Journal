# Description

I was in a dark room illuminated by a central spotlight with various individuals of both sexes. We were all naked and stood shoulder to shoulder around a central square metal frame with two horizontal rectangular pieces that censored our private parts. As I briefly glanced sideways, I realized what was occurring and kept facing forward, trying to avoid eye contact as everyone smiled out of embarrassment.
