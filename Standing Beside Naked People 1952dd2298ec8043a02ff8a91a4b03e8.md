# Description

I was one of many naked peopled standing in a dark room shoulder to shoulder around a central square stainless steel fence with two horizontal rails censoring our private parts, illuminated by a central spotlight. The top rail was flat and the bottom rail was a water bubbler trough. As I briefly glanced sideways, I realized what was occurring and kept facing forward, trying to avoid eye contact as everyone smiled out of embarrassment.
