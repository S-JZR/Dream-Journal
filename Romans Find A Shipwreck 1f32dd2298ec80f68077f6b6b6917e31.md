# Description

I was the captain of a Roman galley, navigating around a mountain along the coastline with many crew members. Each sail was controlled by a pulley system connected to a rope net filled with rocks. Eventually, we encountered another identical empty capsized ship illuminated by a lamp that I instinctively knew was used for distress signals.
