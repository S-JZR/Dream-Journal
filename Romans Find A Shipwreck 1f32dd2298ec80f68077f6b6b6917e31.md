# Description

I was the captain of a Roman galley powered by sails and oars. Each sail was controlled by a pulley system connected to a rope net filled with rocks. While navigating around a mountain along the coastline, we encountered another empty capsized Roman ship, illuminated by the glow of a single lamp that I instinctively knew was used for distress signals.
