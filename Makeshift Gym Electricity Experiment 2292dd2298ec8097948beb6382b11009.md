# Description

I was standing outside the front door of my unit when my mother yelled from the upstairs window that the local children’s sports centre needed help so I had to take a duffel bag of sports equipment there and she invited athletes over to turn my upstairs bedroom into a makeshift gym. For the entire dream, I was confused about where the sports centre was since I don’t know any.

I went inside and saw various athletes packed together in my bedroom, pedalling bicycles as part of an experiment to generate the highest surplus of electricity stored in a one-meter-wide copper coil downstairs, while gradually decreasing the number of running appliances. As black industrial caged lights laying on the carpet were deactivated, I went downstairs to check the results of each test written on labels attached to different copper rings. However, I noticed that despite fewer appliances running, the surplus energy was still gradually decreasing. I suggested to others nearby that potentially multiple factors are at play like the athletes becoming fatigued and less efficient over time.
