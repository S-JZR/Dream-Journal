# Description

I was standing on the oval beside the hall at my secondary school when I overheard the disembodied voice of a female reporter discussing a breaking news snippet from the future about the massacre of 50 students there that day. The cause was not explained, leaving me paranoid about how it would unfold. Staff indoors realized there was insufficient seating for the parade and instructed nearby students to assemble new benches above a narrow rectangular strip of deep water spanning the breadth of the space near the front of the hall. Students initially created a foundation by laying wooden planks with holes on both sides over parallel anchor bolts spaced about one metre apart across the gap. When nearing completion on the right side a student accidentally dropped some planks into the water and hesitated to retrieve them. After walking in circles, watching everyone work and contemplating whether I could reach the planks visible on the sandy bumpy floor by diving under, the supervisor grew annoyed and told me to leave since I wasn't needed. While travelling around to the diagonally opposite corner with other idle students, I feared that feeling left out would trigger me to become a psycho responsible for the massacre, but I reassured myself that this cannot be the case since I didn't want to harm anyone.

Those who continued working covered the entire gap with a green tarp and proceeded to screw a cubic metal frame on top. However, someone accidentally fell through, creating a hole, and couldn't escape. Others performed a synchronized countdown from three to shift the structure, but it bent out of shape as many fell in while debris landed on the surface. Fearing that students might die because they were trapped underneath, I ran to offer assistance. While lifting the tarp, Jared emerged with a rectangular light. I asked how many were down there, and he responded lots as he kept diving under to pull people out including from a cave-like area. Using a flashlight, I scouted dark areas towards the right to ensure nobody was left behind. On the rightmost side, I pulled back the tarp to find Brooke lying semi-conscious on her back soaked in water. I illuminated her eyes, called her name, and asked if she was cold to which she confirmed. I told her about a warm area in the back with other students that she could attend as she arose to walk over and sit in a low-ceiling space with black curtains for the walls, heat lamps on the ceiling, and a few students previously there eating pizza at tables. I don’t think anyone died during the incident.
