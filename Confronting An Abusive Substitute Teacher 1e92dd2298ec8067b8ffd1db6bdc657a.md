# Description

I arrived 15 minutes late to my former primary school and entered my old year 7 classroom where a fictional super abusive blond female substitute teacher was present. She accused me aloud that I must be lazy for arriving late (fundamental attribution error). However, other students defended me by pointing out that this is not necessarily always the case as people can be late simply because of external circumstances beyond their control and it doesn’t reflect the state of their character. Throughout the class, she mocked every small mistake or quirk students made.

At lunch she held me back from recess and asked me to help her water plants outside the library by taking a plastic bag near the front door containing a nearly empty stainless steel and white plastic thermos. After arriving at the year 3 block beside the library, I placed the bag on the ground but the white thermos fell over and she scolded me for being careless. She began watering plants in the centre of the path without giving me any instructions, so I asked, “Is it these?” and she replied, “Yes, of course!”

As I continued following her around the back of the library wall, she finally went too far by texting a student named Tyler to mock his lisp and read the words aloud as she typed to proofread it. I confronted her by saying, “Miss I feel that you are being abusive,” and she replied, “Yes I know but who is going to care? I had enough and decided to walk directly to the administration office to report the incident and request an immediate class change to avoid being the subject of abuse for filing the complaint.

# Interpretations

- Abusive teacher:
    - Shadow self and inner critic accusing me of not being good enough, lazy, and questioning how evil might distort morality. I constantly criticize all of my shortcomings and what I could do better.
    - Combines the worst traits of different teachers and others like making fun of students doing strange things into a monstrous form.
- Watering plants:
    - On rare occasions teachers asked me to help do small side tasks.
    - Holding me back after class references Mrs Barnes asking me to write lines for shape Area.
- Report:
    - Don't tolerate abuse and report it to put an end to it.
    - Anticipate backlash from the individual being reported. Consider staying anonymous or relocating.
    - Reference to reporting individuals and being immediately targeted.
