# Description

I arrived 15 minutes late to my year 7 classroom at my primary school and encountered a super abusive blond female substitute teacher seated behind a desk.

> **Teacher**: Another lazy child arriving late.
**Female Student**: That’s not necessarily true! People can be late because of circumstances beyond their control and it doesn’t reflect their character.
> 

Throughout the class, she mocked every small mistake or quirk students made. At lunch she held me back from recess.

> **Teacher**: Take the plastic bag near the front door containing a white stainless steel thermos and help me water the plants outside the library.
> 

After arriving at the year 3 block beside the library, I placed the bag on the ground but the white thermos fell over.

> **Teacher**: Be careful! You’re so careless!
> 

She began watering plants in the centre of the path without giving me any instructions.

> **Me**: Is it these plants?
**Teacher**: Yes of course!
> 

As I followed her around the back of the library she texted a student named Tyler to mock his lisp while reading the words aloud to proofread it.

> **Me**: Miss I feel that you are being abusive.
**Teacher**: Yes I know but who is going to care?
> 

I had enough and walked directly to the administration office to report the incident and requested an immediate class change to avoid being the subject of abuse for filing the complaint.
