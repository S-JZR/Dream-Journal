# Description

I was standing in the lounge room with my family when I overhead bomber planes carpet bombing outside as each explosion gradually got closer until it became deafeningly loud. I saw the units in the backyard explode and knew we were about to be hit next. I considered hiding beneath the stairs and other places but realized there was nowhere suitable as all the walls would be too thin and soft to offer protection.

I travelled back in time to quickly start preparing a bunker top-down by digging a square hole in front of the TV using a shovel and tossing the dirt onto the carpet. I repeatedly asked my family for help but nobody did so I worked alone. Eventually, I lowered concrete rings for the hatch entrance but realized I needed more space for the main area and would have to add them later so they wouldn’t get in the way.

I asked my family to sit beneath the dining table to test whether a bunker that size would be suitable or if I needed to enlarge the ceiling and walls but again I did it alone. I started preparing a bunker bottom-up by digging the entire rectangular space beneath the dining table and tossing the dirt on the carpet. It took a long time and I never saw it finished.
