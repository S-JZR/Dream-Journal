# Description

I was a construction worker standing beside the road, trying to drive a sign into the ground covered in white pebbles using a hammer but to no avail. Eventually, another employee arrived in a specialized sign hammering vehicle with a vertical piston but was a rogue who had no interest in working who told me to keep hammering and hopefully it will work out. When parking in a nearby shed, a female employee asked if he could pierce her nose by pushing the vehicle's arm tipped with a small spike into it. He agreed but I looked away knowing this wouldn't end well and soon other workers cried out in terror about how she was bleeding profusely.
