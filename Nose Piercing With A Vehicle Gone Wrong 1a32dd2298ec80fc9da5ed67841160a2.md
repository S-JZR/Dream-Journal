# Description

I was a construction worker standing beside the road and tried to drive a sign into the ground covered in white pebbles using a hammer but to no avail. Eventually, a man arrived in a green specialized sign hammering vehicle with a vertical piston and an arm on the back with a pointed tip but he was rebellious and had no interest in working.

> **Man**: Keep hammering and hopefully it will all work out.
> 

After parking in a nearby shed with other workers he was approached by a female employee.

> **Woman 1**: Can you pierce my nose with the the vehicle arm?
> 

> **Man**: Sure, just stand still and I shouldn't take long.
> 

I overheard the conversation from a distance and sought to reprimand him.

> **Me**: Hey, stop!
> 

> **Me**: You will get injured doing something stupid like that!
> 

> **Man**: Would you be quiet and maybe attend your own business.
> 

I looked away knowing it wouldn't end well and soon other workers cried out in terror.

> **Woman 2**: Oh my God, she's bleeding everywhere!
