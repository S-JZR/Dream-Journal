# Description

I was walking through my neighbourhood during the morning when I encountered a tripod alien, rumoured to be built by a neighbour, that chased me. Feeling afraid I ran all the way back to my unit and went upstairs where my mum was still resting in the master bedroom illuminated by a clip-on light on the shelf. Eventually, the alien approached the blinds with its glowing front circular eye trying to see through the fabric so I deactivated the light on the shelf to hide us better and it wandered away.
