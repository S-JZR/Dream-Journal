# Description

I was standing in the woods beside a lake with my family when my dad collected scattered beehives. After returning to the kitchen in our unit, he cut out the honeycomb with a knife, chewed the tops off the brood cells, transformed it into a cake, and boiled it in a pan full of water while the bees still crawled on it. I felt bad for the bees being boiled alive and experiencing unnecessary suffering.
