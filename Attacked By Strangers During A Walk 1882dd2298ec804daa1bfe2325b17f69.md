# Description

I was with a group of fictional friends outside a large house parallel to my unit complex. Concerned for everyone's safety, we decided to walk each person back to their home as the sun began to set. However, while traversing a dirt path surrounded by dense shrubbery, I heard voices and noticed silhouettes. Rushing to the illuminated porch of the friend’s house, I turned back to catch glimpses of them. Instructing my friends to hurry over, I asked if they had seen any strangers, to which they responded affirmatively, mentioning that there were robbers attempting to snatch our belongings.

Returning to investigate the same street outside the big house, we observed figures shining flashlights at us from further down the slanted road. Equipped with a focusable flashlight, I illuminated multiple people in the dark. One of the younger girls with us attempted to dial the police, but strangely was trying to do it through a web search on my old phone. Recognizing the urgency, I retrieved my new phone to call myself. However, it transformed into a small pink device with a tiny screen and the voice of the first responder sounded rough like a radio transmission. After relaying the entire situation, they promptly dispatched police to the area.

I joined my fictional friends sitting on an urban sidewalk, leaning against a short chain-link fence outside someone's lawn filled with pink flowers. One of my more argumentative friends questioned why I kept calling him the wrong name, as text labels hovered over each of their heads. Realizing my mistake, I asked for the correct pronunciation and wrote it on my hand. While observing the night sky, a friend and I noticed a tiny star darting across at an obscenely fast pace until vanishing. I asked whether it was a shooting star or a UFO, to which they responded that it didn't seem normal for it to be traveling so fast and covering the entire sky. Continuing down the street, the shimmering lens of a security camera atop a tall pine tree caught my attention as it swivelled in our direction. We walked past, collectively acknowledging its presence.
