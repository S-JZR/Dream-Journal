# Description

I was walking with a group of fictional friends outside the large house opposite my unit complex. Concerned for everyone's safety, we decided to walk each person back to their home as the sun began to set. However, while traversing a dirt path surrounded by dense shrubbery, I heard voices and noticed silhouettes. Rushing to the illuminated porch of the friend’s house, I turned back to catch glimpses of them.

> **Me**: Hurry, come over here!
**Me**: Did you see anyone?
**Girl**: Yes.
**Girl**: They were robbers trying to steal our belongings.
> 

Returning to investigate the same street outside the big house, we observed figures shining flashlights at us from further down the slanted road. Equipped with a focusable flashlight, I illuminated multiple people in the dark. One of the younger girls with us attempted to dial the police, but strangely was trying to do it through a web search on my old phone. Recognizing the urgency, I retrieved my new phone to call myself. However, it transformed into a small pink device with a tiny screen and the female voice of the emergency dispatcher sounded rough like a radio transmission.

> **Woman**: Hello, what is your emergency?
**Me**: [Relaying the situation].
> 

After telling them the details they promptly dispatched police.

I joined my fictional friends sitting on an urban sidewalk, leaning against a short chain-link fence outside someone's lawn filled with pink flowers.

> **Male Teenager**: Why do you keep calling me the wrong name?
> 

I saw text labels hovering over everyone's head.

> **Me**: What is the correct pronunciation of your name?
**Male Teenager**: Cillian.
> 

I wrote the pronunciation on my left palm. While observing the night sky, a friend and I noticed a tiny bright dot streak across the sky and vanish.

> **Me**: Was that a shooting star or a UFO?
**Friend**: It didn't seem normal for it to rapidly travel across the sky.
> 

Continuing down the street, the shimmering lens of a security camera atop a tall pine tree caught my attention as it swivelled in our direction. We walked past, collectively acknowledging its presence.
