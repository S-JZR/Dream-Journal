# Description

I was in the lounge room of my unit complex when my mother was conversing with a neighbour on the couch. Soon a super storm arrived, pelting down rain diagonally that obscured everything in a haze as two loud bolts of lightning occurred simultaneously every five seconds. I watched the whole ordeal unfold in the backyard from the kitchen window by peeling back the blinds. To prevent the clothes on the line under the plastic tarp from getting wetter they gathered them in a basket but everything was completely saturated upon completion. Eventually, the storm mostly subsided and the sun began shinning through the clouds at the front yard but tiny lightning bolts still flickered in the sky.
