# Description

I was in a videogame created by a Japanese developer and entered an abandoned dark building:

- Centre:
    - U-shaped control panel with a few paintings on the floor leaning against it.
- Back:
    - Shut door.

I tried placing the paintings on the control panel to load a level but nothing occurred. I slid open the door at the back and encountered the series of level selection rooms with doors from Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf but they were dark and boarded up with wooden planks. The theme song also quietly played. I tried lifting the boards but they wouldn’t budge. When returning to the main room, I encountered a boss fight with a green monster resembling Godzilla as the atmosphere glowed orange. It shot fire at me but I moved side to side, shooting at it until it died. I thought this video game was confusing since nothing was explained and there was no feedback.
