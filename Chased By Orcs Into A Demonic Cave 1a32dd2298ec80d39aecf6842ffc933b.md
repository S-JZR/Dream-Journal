# Description

I was in a fantasy role-playing game playing as a human adventurer when a group of tall orcs ambushed me outside a village, relentlessly attacking until my health reached a critical level. I fled through an arch-shaped dirt bridge and descended a U-shaped path into a cave. TY The Tasmanian Tiger was grinding rails to collect rings and performing homing attacks to gather flying opals. Eventually, a cut scene unfolded with an earthquake shaking the cave, causing a glowing pentagram to slowly emerge from the ground and I immediately shutoff the game due to personal convictions.
