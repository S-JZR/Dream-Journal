# Description

I was one of many students seated in a university lecture room listening to a middle-aged female staff member give an orientation presentation in front of a projector.

> **Woman**: Government reports indicate that student performance has declined across schools and a record number are dropping out before finishing their degrees.
**Woman**: The government is launching an initiative to address these issues.
> 

We visited an art museum to see large war dioramas built into the wall to build our confidence about the degree.

- Left:
    - Forked trench leading to the horizon.
    - Hundreds of small faceless artist mannequins wearing white cloth standing in the trench.
- Right:
    - Metal samurais standing around a gong.
    - Pagodas in the background.

After instantly progressing through an entire visual art degree, I was asked in the capstone project to design a diorama despite never being taught the skills. I was uncertain about how to proceed and felt like I was being scammed since I could have learned these skills elsewhere or online without incurring student loan debt. When the presentation ended, everyone went to a small convenience store to the side and lined up at the checkout as the staff member served everyone. Many rectangular lint chocolates with gold wrapping were laid across the counter.

> **Woman**: Would any of you like to buy some to raise money for charity?
> 

The university hosted an art competition and invited various local and international students, including me. Dejan, a friend from secondary school, was there to help me. The international students, including Tom from secondary school, flew in by plane but were delayed due to government restrictions from Cyclone Alfred passing by the coast.

- Most students created illuminated arcade machines.
- Other students created a modern art diorama with yellow walls overlaid with black square patches, symbolizing triumphing over danger.
- The international students created a mediocre Pac-Man icon on a black rug.

> **International Students**: It’s annoying that we couldn’t be here sooner but we’re grateful for the chance to participate with such amazing people.
> 

> **Female Students**: As women it's unbearable to exist in a world oppressed by issues like the gender wage gap.
> 

I was walking through a supermarket checkout, connected to a restaurant at the university, run by a male cashier.

> **Cashier**: Take the orders of those two customers sitting at wooden booths to the side.
> 

I messed up something which upset the customers and he brought up a hologram.

> **Cashier**: As you can see, these are the details you formatted incorrectly.
**Cashier**: Now go do the other orders.
**Me**: It’s your job to be the waiter and I’m here as a customer.
> 

He was angry that I stood up for myself. While walking away into the underground carpark where my family was getting into my mum’s car I heard the cashier approaching from behind.

> **Cashier**: You’re unemployed!
**Cashier**: What do you do with your time at home for ten hours a day?
**Cashier**: You could be contributing to the university!
**Cashier**: You’re a slacker!
**Cashier**: You don’t know what you’re doing with your life!
> 

After arriving at Subway, I walked behind the counter as staff let me look around while they worked. However, the previous cashier also worked there and entered through the front door carrying a stainless steel tray of meatballs. Upon seeing me, he threw a tantrum by hurling a few at customers and activated the fire alarm behind the counter. He walked towards the customers and yelled as the manager passively confronted him and briefly held his arms but he continued.

> **Manager**: Stop!… Stop!… Stop!

    - I had female students in a CI class once who were researching how women are oppressed by male dominated industries.
