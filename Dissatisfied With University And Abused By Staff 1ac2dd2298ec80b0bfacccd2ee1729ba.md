# Description

I was seated in a university lecture room with various people, listening to a middle-aged female staff member give an orientation presentation in front of a projector. She acknowledges that government reports indicate that student performance has declined across schools and a record number are dropping out before finishing their degrees. However, the government was launching an initiative to address these issues. To build confidence, we were taken into an art museum to view two large dioramas about war built into the wall. The left displayed a forked trench leading to the horizon filled with hundreds of small faceless poseable artist mannequins in white cloth. The right displayed metal samurais standing around a gong with pagodas in the background. I endured an entire visual art degree while I was there, but during the capstone project, we were asked to design dioramas like the previous ones despite never being taught the skills. I was uncertain about how to proceed and felt like I was being scammed since I could have learned these skills elsewhere or online without incurring student loan debt. After the presentation, everyone went to a small convenience store to the side and lined up at the checkout as the staff member served everyone behind the counter. There was a bunch of rectangular lint chocolates with gold wrapping laid across the counter and she asked everyone whether they would like to raise money for charity by purchasing some.

The university hosted an art competition and invited various local and international students, including me. Dejan from school was there to help me. Most students created illuminated arcade machines. Other students created a modern art diorama with yellow walls overlaid with black square patches, symbolizing triumphing over danger. Female students complained about how unbearable it is to exist as a woman in a world threatened by issues like the gender wage gap. The international students, including Tom from school, had flown in by plane but were significantly delayed due to government restrictions caused by a recent cyclone passing by the coast. When they arrived, they used the little time left to make mediocre works like a Pac-Man icon on a black rug. They were upset about not being there but tried to stay positive, expressing gratitude for the chance to participate in such an event with amazing people.

While going through a supermarket checkout connected to a restaurant at the university, the male cashier-waiter asked me to take the orders of two customers sitting at wooden booths to the side. However, when returning, I messed up something with both, which upset the customers. He reprimanded me, showing the issue on holograms, and told me to take other orders. However, I stood up for myself and said that it was his job to be the waiter and I was there as a customer while walking off into the underground car park where my family was waiting by a car. As I was about to get in, I heard the waiter’s disgruntled voice approaching from behind as he verbally abused me about being unemployed. He questioned what I did with my time at home for 10 hours a day when I could be contributing to the university. He called me a slacker and told me I didn’t know what I was doing with my life.

Upon driving to a fast food restaurant resembling Subway, I walked behind the counter as staff let me check things out while they worked. However, the man from before also worked there and entered through the front door carrying a stainless steel tray of meatballs. Upon seeing me, he threw a tantrum by hurling a few at customers and pressing a button on a white wall-mounted phone behind the counter to set off the fire alarm. The manager confronted him to stop but merely stood beside him, issuing warnings and briefly holding his arms as he continued.
