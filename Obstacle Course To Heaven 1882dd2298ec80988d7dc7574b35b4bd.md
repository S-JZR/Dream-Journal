# Description

I was standing on a rectangular platform in a black void in the afterlife with other people in front of a vertical obstacle course leading to heaven comprising a series of levitating cubes. The cubes measured two metres on all sides, were dark grey, had glowing rainbow outlines, and rotated periodically. Everyone could freely swap between these choices:

- Not bet their limbs for a standard afterlife experience with infinite attempts.
- Bet their limbs for a premium afterlife experience with finite attempts, losing their limbs after failing and risking being trapped at the bottom forever if they couldn't climb.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - I’ve always struggled with believing in God.
- Christianity:
    - Betting limbs sounds like a morbid parody of Matthew 5:30.

## Symbols

- Obstacle Course:
    - Heaven feels impossible to reach and I don’t know where to begin.

## Lessons

- N/A.
