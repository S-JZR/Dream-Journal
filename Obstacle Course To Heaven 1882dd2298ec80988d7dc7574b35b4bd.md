# Description

I was in a black void in the afterlife, standing on a rectangular platform with a group of people. In front of it was a vertical obstacle course leading to heaven, comprising a series of levitating dark grey cubes spanning the height of an adult at various elevations. They rotated periodically and had glowing rainbow outlines. Everyone had the choice to have infinite free attempts for a standard afterlife experience or bet their limbs, which were removed after failing, for a more deluxe experience. Those who lost limbs had to continue with whatever remained and risked being trapped at the bottom forever.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I’ve always struggled with believing in God.
- Betting limbs: it seems like a morbid parody of Matthew 5:30.

## Symbols

- Obstacle course: heaven feels impossible to reach and I don’t know where to begin.

## Lessons

- N/A.
