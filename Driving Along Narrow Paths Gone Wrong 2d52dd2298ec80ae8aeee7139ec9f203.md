# Description

I was seated in my mum’s car being driven by my mum with the windows rolled down along a narrow long path made of light grey pebbles elevated three metres off the ground in a grassland. Another woman was driving a car in front of us and dust clouds flew across the windshield which obscured my mum’s vision. I rolled up the windows to keep the dust out. Mum didn’t know where the edge of the path was or if there were potholes so she drove slowly.

After reaching the other side, we travelled left through a curved three metre deep narrow trench and deviated into a descending spiralling path to the right until we encountered the back of a buried car. We reversed back, I placed a caution sign in front of the path, and I wrote the reason why it was dangerous on it with a permanent marker. A male bystander drove past and asked if everything was ok and whether anyone was buried alive in the car but I said that I didn’t know.
