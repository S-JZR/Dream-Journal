# Description

I was in a room with portals in each corner when I was forced to enter one and became a somewhat naïve fat teenager in their house, trying to make a video game about knocking soap bars around to reach a destination and avoiding rubber ducks. What upset me was that they never considered complex philosophies and when I tried to recall who I was before, my memories gradually faded until nothing was left.
