# Description

I was standing in a white room with portals in each corner when I was forced to enter one and became a naïve male teenager seated at a computer in their room. He was making an 8-bit videogame about pushing a soap bar across bathroom tiles to a target destination without touching white folded towels and rubber ducks scattered on the floor. What upset me was that they never considered complex philosophies and when I tried to recall who I was before, my memories gradually faded until nothing was left.
