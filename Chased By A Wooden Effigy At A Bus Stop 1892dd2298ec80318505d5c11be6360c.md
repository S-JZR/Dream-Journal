# Description

I was waiting at a bus stop in a suburb at night with an adult man when a wooden effigy monster with glowing red eyes appeared in the distance. What initially started off as sluggish steps gradually accelerated until it began sprinting towards us. Instinctively, we scurried up concrete stairs from behind towards a set of 2x2 yellow plastic wheelie bins beside a brick building. The other man attempted to hide inside one, but his legs were halfway out by the time the creature reached him and dragged him out to assault him.
