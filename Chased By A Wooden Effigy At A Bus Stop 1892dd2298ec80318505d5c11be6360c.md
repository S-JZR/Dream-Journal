# Description

While waiting at the bus stop with another young adult man in an urban suburb during the night, a wooden effigy monster appeared on the streets from afar, turning to walk towards us as its red eyes brightly shined. What initially started off as sluggish steps gradually accelerated until it began sprinting towards us. Instinctively, we scurried up concrete stairs from behind towards a set of 2x2 yellow plastic wheelie bins beside a brick building. The other man attempted to hide inside one, but his legs were halfway out by the time the creature reached him and dragged him out to assault him.
