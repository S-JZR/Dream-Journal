I was standing in my unit when I discovered Jayba, my cat, who had been left outside ran away from home. I drove through multiple suburbs until finding her sitting in the middle of a shopping mall carpark.

# Interpretations

- We often let Jayba outside the front of our unit and she has occasionally wandered far away.

## Symbols

- Lost: the fear of losing Jayba.

## Lessons

- Don’t leave your cat outside unattended and without a leash.
