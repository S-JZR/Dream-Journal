# Description

I was standing amongst Chinese market stalls setup on a closed road beside my local shopping mall with my family and a large crowd. While walking through the markets my mother bought us fried chicken covered in a white sauce in a transparent plastic container. I took a few bites and could taste the sauce which was delicious.

After getting multiple fruit boxes, we walked over to the checkouts in a concrete area where the roads previously were. My mother recognised the male cashier who was the only one present and he greeted her and prioritized us first. A few other Asian women behind us were annoyed because he was taking a long time counting each piece of fruit on the counter.

The line grew to over 1000 people over time so I grabbed the loudspeaker walkie talkie hanging from the ceiling and requested for more cashiers at the front twice but nobody came. As night fell, the crowd grew restless, left their goods behind, and wandered away without buying anything.
