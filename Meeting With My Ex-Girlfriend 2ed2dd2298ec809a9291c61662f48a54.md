# Description

I was seated at my computer in my unit when my fictional ex-girlfriend with blonde hair from university messaged me at 7AM.

> **Woman**: Hey want to meetup later at the library on campus?
**Me**: Yes I will be there.
> 

I quickly got dressed and ate breakfast as my dad stood in the kitchen a bit confused.

> **Dad**: Why are you up so early?
**Me**: I’m going to meet someone at university.
> 

I was delayed by chores for 20 minutes and riding the bus to campus for 40 minutes. I felt guilty for being late and worried she would think I didn’t care about her or that I was a fake when she messaged me on the way.

> **Woman**: I’ve been waiting for a while, are you still coming?
**Me**: I really wanted to get there earlier but other tasks got in the way.
**Me**: I should be arriving soon.
> 

Eventually, I arrived at the campus and met her in front of an elevator to the left of the library that travelled to the roof.

> **Me**: I’m here, sorry for not being here sooner.
**Me**: Do you want to go somewhere more private to talk about things?
**Woman**: Sure but where did you want to go?
**Me**: We could take that elevator to the roof.
**Woman**: Won’t there be people around looking at the view?
**Me**: Probably not this early in the day.
**Woman**: Ok, lead the way.
> 

We entered the elevator and ascended to the rooftop terrace which featured stone tiles, four wooden and metal benches, and a stone parapet.
