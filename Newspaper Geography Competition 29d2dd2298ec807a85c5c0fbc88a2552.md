# Description

I was seated on the sofa in my unit watching TV when an adult male news anchor discussed a viral geography competition in a newspaper, offering an all-expenses-paid trip to a secret location. The competition involved:

- Coloured 2D world map with diagonally striped regions printed across two pages.
- Guessing the location of a fictional individual by eliminating countries they were not in.
- 40 hints from their adventures were provided in a box spanning the bottom of the pages (e.g., “I would prefer to be in a place that is never short of potatoes as the thought of a famine scares me.”). They required a strong understanding of history and life in different countries.
- Submit the answer for a chance to win.
