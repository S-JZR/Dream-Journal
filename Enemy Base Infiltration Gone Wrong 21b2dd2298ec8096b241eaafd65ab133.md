# Description

I was one of a few spies wearing yellow wetsuits exiting the ocean onto a circular concrete platform to infiltrate an enemy sea base connected to an island. After opening a manhole, we descended into the basement and encountered a deadly obstacle course inside a long tunnel.

Obstacle one comprised a series of rectangular platforms moving side by side in alternating directions. All we had to do was move across the middle as their offset created a continuous path.

Obstacle two comprised a series of platforms randomly alternating between being on fire and extinguished. We put on red fireproof suits, and I spontaneously began jumping across them. One member asked, “Does anyone remember what order they went in?” I said no. Someone behind me got slightly scorched by a burst of flames and yelped.

We entered a wide room resembling a simple train station lobby, with four side rooms accessed via hallways with ramps. While inside a side room which was filled with shelves of food and candy in glass cases, I overheard the villain appear on a screen in the main room, announcing they were going to trap us inside and take all our food. Worried the food might drop down chutes, I used my arm to sweep everything onto the floor. I also feared they might seal the side rooms, so I stuffed some items down my shirt and returned but nothing occurred.

We proceeded forward into a large room on the top floor of a crowded football stadium in the USA, where a band was preparing to play. However, suspecting the band was contributing to the villain, I decided to stop them by any means necessary. I yelled “Allahu Akbar” as half of them fled into the hallway and fired a machine gun into the ceiling to scare away the rest. Outside the stadium, Julien and I walked with Julien down a footpath with grassy fields on both sides as a large crowd fled ahead. A nuclear explosion erupted over the horizon as a male voice over speakers warned everyone that a nuke had detonated ahead and instructed them to travel in opposite direction to avoid radiation poisoning that could cause limb loss or cancer. Most of the crowd at the back who heard the message turned back. I told Julien this was about the third dream I have had involving nuclear explosions.
