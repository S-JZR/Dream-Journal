# Description

I was one of many university students seated in a creative industries classroom when my entire team was absent. We had a presentation due tomorrow that we didn’t start which involved showcasing a storyboard about a real world problem. Earlier in the semester, I proposed some vague ideas to my team about someone being addicted to their phone and a female team member claimed they would work hard on it later but didn’t. I messaged my team on social media:

> **Me**: I’m in the classroom alone right now, where is everyone?
> 

> **Woman 1**: We are still working on multiple mini essays released earlier.
> 

> **Woman 1:** We can’t make it.
> 

> **Me**: I just finished that and moved onto the presentation.
> 

> **Me**: I’m going to pull out a personal idea from my vault to try saving you all.
> 

Due to the limited time, I compromised by drawing 2D black and white images and writing whatever I could for the slides since it would be quick. My storyboard involved:

1. A man scrolling on his phone standing in a black void with barb wire around the perimeter.
2. He started doom scrolling and barb wire flew out of the phone screen and down his throat.
3. The barb wire exited from different parts of his body and wrapped around him.
4. He was suspended by the barb wire and merged with it as he continued doom scrolling.

Another team of women presented their storyboard draft to the teacher.

> **Woman 2**: For our presentation, we centred on how LGBT+ people feel Christianity is erasing their identity and making them feel invisible.
> 

Their storyboard involved:

1. A stream of water fell from the sky onto a Caucasian woman and created a large crater.
2. The water rushed over her and washed away her facial details and skin colour.
3. She gradually turned into a smooth white translucent figure.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - For a creative industries group assessment at university, my team members were overly optimistic that we had similar personality types from the test at [https://www.16personalities.com/](https://www.16personalities.com/) and we were going to do well and get a seven. By the end of the semester, they struggled to contribute due to other assessments. In the same class, women in another team were researching how women were oppressed by a male dominated industry.
    - For a solo creative industries assessment at university, I drew a simple 2D storyboard for a zine because I wasn’t skilled enough and was running out of time.
    - The storyboard was based on one of my real art ideas about being in barb wire and feeling trapped by simultaneous problems and constant upsetting media, all consuming me.
