# Description

I was standing outside a church with my family and other Christians when we were instantly raptured to a dystopian heaven:

- Sky:
    - Overcast and raining.
- Left and right:
    - Tall dark grey concrete brutalist buildings without windows and each level got gradually more narrow.
    - Devoid of people.
- Floor:
    - Cobblestone.

My dad worried about all the DVDs our family had collected over time, realizing we couldn’t bring any to heaven and it was ultimately futile.
