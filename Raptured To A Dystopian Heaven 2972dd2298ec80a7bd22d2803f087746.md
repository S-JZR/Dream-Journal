# Description

I was standing outside a church with my family and other Christians when we were instantly raptured to a dystopian heaven:

- sky:
    - overcast and raining
- left and right:
    - tall dark grey windowless concrete skyscrapers that got narrower each level
    - devoid of people
- floor:
    - cobblestone.

My Dad started to realize we couldn’t bring anything to heaven with a worried expression and the time my parents spent collecting DVDs was ultimately futile.

> **Dad**: But what about all the DVDs we collected?
