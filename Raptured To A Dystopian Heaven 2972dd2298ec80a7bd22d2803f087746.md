# Description

I was standing outside a church with my family and other Christians when we were instantly raptured to a dystopian heaven:

- sky:
    - overcast and raining
- left and right:
    - tall dark grey windowless concrete skyscrapers that got narrower each level
    - devoid of people
- floor:
    - cobblestone.

My dad worried about all the DVDs our family had collected over time, realizing we couldn’t bring any to heaven and it was ultimately futile.
