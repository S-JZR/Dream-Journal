# Description

I was standing on the bottom floor of a grey shopping mall with two floors beside escalators leading to a large open outdoor area with a concrete floor, round table seating with umbrellas, grass, and a wooden fence. I noticed Grunt and Predator models from Metal Arms Glitch In The System outside in the corner to the left. I programmed them into a wave-based survival game by making them pathfind to the previous bottom floor.

Various people play tested the game with guns.

It quickly became obvious that various bugs were present including the starting timer skipping a second and enemies getting stuck on walls and objects. When the enemies reached the bottom floor, they opened fire on the nearest players, and everyone fought back.
