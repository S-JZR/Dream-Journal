# Description

I was in my unit when a few mischievous children knocked on the door and asked to come inside so I let them in. However, when my back was turned briefly they went upstairs to look through our possessions and one of them walked downstairs with a green toy guns so I realized they were planning to steal things. When I went upstairs to my room I tried flicking the light switch but they had unscrewed the lightbulb and I could only see their silhouettes in the dark. I didn’t know whether they were armed or could harm me so I went to the kitchen where my dad was to relay the situation and obtain sharp ended knives from the drawer to defend myself. While busy doing that the children sprinted outside towards a yellow Taxi in the garage to make an escape. I followed closely behind them and stabbed two in the back by 1cm to get their attention to stop but they kept running so I tripped them onto the concrete where they grazed their face and arms but they kept moving. They entered the Taxi and told a young amateur Indian driver to move to another location but I told him to wind his window down. While the children begged him to go I told him to stop because it was a crime by association but he tried justifying himself by saying something about what was on his resume. I interrupted him at the top of my voice saying those children are thieves, if you help them then you’re also guilty by association, exit the Taxi if you don’t want to go to jail! With a concerned expression he exited the Taxi and a child jumped into the driver’s seat and sped off down the road.
