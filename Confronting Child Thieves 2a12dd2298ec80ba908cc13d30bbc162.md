# Description

I was standing in my unit when a few mischievous children knocked on the front door and asked to come inside so I let them in. However, when I briefly turned my back, they ran upstairs into my room to search through my possessions. One of them sneaked downstairs holding a green toy gun and I realized they were stealing.

I went upstairs to confront them and tried activating the light but they had unscrewed the lightbulb and I could only see their silhouettes in the dark. I didn’t know whether they were armed so I went to the kitchen where my dad was to relay the situation and grabbed a knife with a sharp tip to defend myself.

The children took the opportunity to sprint outside towards a yellow Taxi in unit 4’s garage. I chased them and poked two in the back with the knife to try getting them to stop. However, they kept running so I tripped them onto the concrete where they grazed their face and arms but they kept moving and entered the Taxi. I approached the driver’s window to confront a teenage male Indian.

> **Me**: Roll down the window.
**Children**: Please just go! Don’t listen to him! Come on hurry up!
**Me**: This is a crime by association.
**Driver**: Don’t worry on my resume it says…
**Me**: Those children are thieves!
**Me**: If you don’t want to be labelled a criminal and go to jail for helping them then exit the Taxi!

The driver looked concerned and stepped out as a child jumped into the driver’s seat and sped off down the road.
