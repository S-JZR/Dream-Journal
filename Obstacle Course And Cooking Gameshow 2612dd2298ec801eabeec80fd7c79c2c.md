# Description

I was one of many contestants on a gameshow that involved racing to cook a dish by collecting ingredients via an obstacle course. Everyone was divided into four different teams and stood outside in lines in front of a large deep rectangular area filled with scattered tall square podiums. All surfaces were covered in crash mats that were blue on the higher sections and white on the lower ones. Members took turns crossing the podiums to reach the other side, retrieve an ingredient from a square table, and bring it back. If anyone fell down, a ramp at the back allowed them to return to the start and the next member immediately took their place. After a team retrieved all ingredient they collaborated to cook a dish and serve it to the judges.
