# Description

I was sorting various cluttered objects on the carpet in my room in my unit when I uncovered a backpack containing a mixture of obscure items in the side and main compartments including toys and print photographs. I felt afraid of losing them forever and realized I needed to create a permanent backup by digitizing them (e.g., taking photos and scanning).
