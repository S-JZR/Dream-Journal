# Description

I was one of many soldiers infiltrating a futuristic fortress. I was armed with the Brass Beast and the Gloves of Running Urgently from Team Fortress 2. After breaching, we navigated through an elevated white hallway to a square room. Enemy personnel emerged from a square-shaped hole in the ceiling, initiating a firefight we eventually overcame. Progressing through three sloped 90-degree hallways to the second floor, I grew frustrated with our slow pace. Sprinting ahead using the gloves dwindled my health, leading to an unfortunate demise as powerful guardians ambushed me around the corner.

In my second attempt, returning to the square room, I sprinted down the hallway, continuously jumping, which boosted my speed and prevented health loss. I transformed into a bulky character wielding an enormous mallet. A woman ventured outside, catching the attention of three small autonomous sentries perched on a wall beside the doorway, which briefly turned before unleashing a relentless barrage of gunfire. With determination, I ascended to their position, swiftly dismantling them. Turning the corner around a pillar, we faced the formidable sight of a shipyard with hundreds of armed soldiers, all raising their guns towards us. Nonchalantly, I advanced towards them, absorbing their gunfire as I embarked on a rampage, wounding many in the process.
