# Description

My family was about to embark on a vacation to Hawaii but needed to retrieve valuables from a garage on a rural mountain in Japan. Hitching a ride on a pickup truck with a disgruntled male driver, we ascended to a vantage point overlooking an ocean bridge connecting the urban and rural regions. Halfway up, I asked the driver to halt for an opportunity to search the garage. He reluctantly conceded, stipulating a strict five-minute time constraint before travelling elsewhere. We frantically dismounted and flung open the garage door before rummaging through the boxes, placing valuable items like paintings and tools into a duffle bag. Growing increasingly impatient, the driver bellowed that our time had expired, prompting us to climb aboard the truck when a slight opening in the corrugated door caught my attention.

Concerned that unscrupulous residents might seize the chance to plunder its contents, I brought the issue to the driver's attention. He sighed with reluctance, warning that stepping off the truck would mean I'd have to find alternative transport to the airport. Realizing no one would pass through the area for a while, I knew there was a significant risk of covering the entire distance on foot. Despite the odds, the urge to protect our belongings prevailed, so I leapt off the truck as it sped away. Seeking assistance, I entered a nearby building to discover an active church service. While navigating through the hallway, a welcome team wearing green shirts extended fliers for a product, but I politely declined, returning to the garage and resuming work in solitude. Eventually, the welcome team approached, offering assistance in moving the boxes. Despite harbouring reservations about their motives, I acknowledged this as my only viable option and invited them inside.

Suddenly, I stood in front of my garage in Australia, searching for leftover belongings, but it was empty. Wondering where my items went, an unknown Asian individual revealed he had emptied all the garages to make way for the construction of a new house.

Two duffle bags were filled when I returned to Japan, and the welcome team directed me back to the church hallway for additional help. I was offered a flyer for a fictional courier service as another person scolded them, claiming I had already received one, but I clarified my interest. I asked if the post office could hold the packages until we returned from vacation, but they warned that there was no guarantee it wouldn't be redirected. Given our short stay, I decided to send the packages to Australia, hopeful our return would precede their arrival. After crossing the bridge into the city and arriving at the airport as night fell, I flew to reunite with my family. On a cantilever bridge with a pedestrian underpass, my parents conversed with an acquaintance who had opened a coffee shop. As my attention waned, I noticed the lack of hand sanitizer on the exterior of a nearby bathroom and restocked the dispensers.
