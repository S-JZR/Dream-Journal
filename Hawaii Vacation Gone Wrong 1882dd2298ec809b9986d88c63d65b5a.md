# Description

I was about to go on a vacation to Hawaii with my family but needed to retrieve valuables from a garage on a rural mountain in Japan. Hitching a ride on a pickup truck with a disgruntled male driver, we ascended halfway up to a vantage point overlooking an ocean bridge connecting the urban and rural regions.

> **Me**: This is our stop.
**Me**: Can you wait here while we search the garage to retrieve our possessions?
**Driver**: Sure but I’m only going to wait for exactly five minutes then I’m off.
> 

We frantically dismounted and flung open the corrugated garage door before rummaging through the boxes, placing valuable items like paintings and tools into a duffle bag.

> **Driver**: Your time is up! Get back on or you’re getting left behind!
> 

As we climbed aboard the truck I noticed a slight opening in the garage door.

> **Me**: I didn’t lock the garage door properly.
**Me**: I’m worried that strangers might steal whatever is left.
**Me**: Can I quickly go lock it?
**Driver**: *sigh* If you step off the truck again you will have to find your own way to the airport.
> 

Realizing nobody would pass through the area for a while, I knew there was a significant risk of covering the entire distance on foot. Despite the odds, the urge to protect our belongings prevailed, so I leapt off the truck as it sped away. Seeking assistance, I entered a nearby building to discover an active church service. While navigating through the hallway, a welcome team wearing green shirts extended fliers for a product.

> **Man 1**: Would you like...
**Me**: No thanks.
> 

I returned to the garage to work alone and later the welcome team visited.

> **Man 2**: We noticed you earlier and we are wondering if you would like some help.
> 

I was hesitant to trust them but I realized this was my only viable option.

> **Me**: Yes, come in.
> 

We filled two duffle bags and the welcome team directed me back to the church hallway for additional help. I was offered the same flyer earlier for an international courier service.

> **Man 1**: Don't give them that! They already received one!
**Me**: Actually I'm still interested.
**Me**: Can the post office hold the packages until we return from vacation?
**Man 1**: There’s no guarantee it won’t be redirected.
> 

I decided to send the packages to Australia given our short vacation and hoped we would return before they arrived. I hitched a ride with a church member who drove me across the bridge to the airport as night fell. I booked a flight to Hawaii and boarded the plane to reunite with my family.
