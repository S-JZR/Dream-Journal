# Description

I was standing in the city with my mum when a powerful earthquake caused buildings to collapse, forcing us to flee in separate directions. After everything settled, I began searching for her and encountered a group of people gathering together who had also lost someone. A woman soon appeared to share tragic news by showing various holographic portraits of those who were found dead and one of them was my mother. Many people walked away and I roamed the city for hours not knowing what to do.
