# Description

I was standing in the backyard of my unit, which was part of a row of red/brown brick units, when another row of similar units to the right transformed into smooth black modern houses with exteriors mainly comprising tall glass windows.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- 2009: there used to be a single rundown house beside ours that was surrounded by dense shrubbery but it was demolished and replaced with modern red brick and white concrete units.

## Symbols

- Modern units: recognising the impermanence of the world and memories.

## Lessons

- Everything changes and what seems permeant can disappear suddenly or long after we’re gone.
