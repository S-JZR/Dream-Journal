# Description

While standing in the backyard of my red brick unit complex, the row of units on the right transformed into sleek dark grey modern houses with exteriors mainly comprising tall glass windows.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- 2009: there used to be a single rundown house beside ours that was surrounded by dense shrubbery but it was demolished and replaced with modern red brick and white concrete units.

## Symbols

- Modern units: recognising the impermanence of the world and memories.

## Lessons

- Everything changes and what seems permeant can disappear suddenly or long after we’re gone.
