# Description

I was standing in the backyard of my unit, which was part of a row of red/brown brick units, when another row of similar units to the right transformed into smooth black modern houses with exteriors mainly comprising tall glass windows.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - 2009: a rundown house surrounded by dense shrubbery beside our unit was replaced with modern red/brown brick and white concrete units.

## Symbols

- Modern Units:
    - Impermanence of the world and memories.

## Lessons

- Everything changes and what seems permanent can disappear suddenly or long after we’re gone.
