# Description

I was standing in the carpark of my unit complex when my brother climbed a large tree onto the red terracotta roof of the second set of garages. Suddenly, my male neighbour from unit one exited his front door onto the footpath beside the car park with a pump-action shotgun and fired a shot at my brother’s torso which sent him tumbling back but he was unharmed.
