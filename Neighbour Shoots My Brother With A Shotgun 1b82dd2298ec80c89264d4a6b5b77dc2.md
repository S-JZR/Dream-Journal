# Description

I was in the parking area of my unit complex when my brother climbed the large tree outside one set of garages to get onto the red terracotta roof. Suddenly, my male neighbour from unit one exited his front door onto the footpath beside the car park with a pump-action shotgun and fired a shot at my brother’s torso which sent him tumbling back but he was unharmed.
