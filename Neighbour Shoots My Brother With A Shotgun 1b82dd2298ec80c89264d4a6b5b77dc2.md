# Description

I was standing in the carpark of my unit complex when my brother climbed a large tree onto the red/brown terracotta roof of the second set of garages. Suddenly, my male neighbour from unit one exited his front door onto the footpath beside the car park with a pump-action shotgun and fired a shot at my brother’s torso which sent him tumbling back but he was unharmed.
