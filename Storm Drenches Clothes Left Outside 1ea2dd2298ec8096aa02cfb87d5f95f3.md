# Description

I was standing in the kitchen in my unit with my brother when my mum hung lots of clothes on fold-out metal lines in the backyard and frontyard. She warned us about a storm before leaving.

> **Mum**: A storm is approaching our area.
> 

> **Mum**: You both need to bring in the clothes by 3pm to stop them from getting wet.
> 

My brother and I got distracted talking to each other for hours when it started raining heavily and I remembered that we forgot about the clothes.

> **Me**: We forgot to bring in the clothes!
> 

> **Me**: Quick, you do the backyard and I'll do the frontyard!
> 

The clothes were completely soaked by the time we got them inside.
