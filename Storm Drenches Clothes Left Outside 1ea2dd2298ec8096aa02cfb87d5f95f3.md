# Description

I was standing in the lounge room of my unit with my brother in the kitchen when my mum hung lots of clothes on fold-out metal lines in the backyard and frontyard. Before leaving, she warned us that a storm was approaching and we needed to bring the clothes in at a specific time to prevent them from getting drenched. However, after getting distracted talking with my brother in the kitchen, it began to rain heavily. I suddenly remembered we had forgotten to bring in the clothes and suggested we split up to gather them but they were completely soaked by the time we got them inside.
