# Description

I was one of many secondary school students wearing swimming clothes on an excursion to a water theme park. Upon arriving, we waited in line at the front counter when Mrs Brown asked everyone whether they were registered and I realized that I forgot to do it. I quickly pulled out my phone to try registering but couldn't do it in time as the line shortened. Steven and Jayden, bullies from primary school, were sitting on the floor to the left and harassing me. I threatened to stab them with a knife if they tried to touch me which provoked them to chase me.

I fled halfway upstairs and pushed Steven down the stairs. I found a duffel bag in the upstairs room containing a spike and sickle which I used to impale and push Jayden down the stairs. Both tumbled to the ground floor and were knocked unconscious. Other students gathered around them in shock to see if they were ok and wanted to find the perpetrator. I felt guilty for my impulsive actions that I didn't mean to do and was afraid of getting two life sentences for murder if they died so I escaped by lowering myself out the front window onto the streets. I was waiting to catch a bus but missed the first one that just left. I overheard a news report saying they were in the hospital with Steven discharged and Jayden in a stable condition which made me feel relieved.
