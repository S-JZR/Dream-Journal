# Description

I was in my unit's living room with a car, draining its fuel into an ice cream tub by cutting the fuel line with a circular saw. Sparks leapt erratically around the room as drops of fuel ignited. Fearing the fire would travel through the piping and trigger an explosion, I desperately grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher, smothering it with smog. Yet as the clouds dissipated, the car rattled deep within, prompting me to continue squeezing the handle to no avail.

Rising from the floor, I rushed upstairs, urging my family to evacuate. As we exited in an orderly fashion, I realized our cat was still inside. Instinctively, I ran to the top floor, grabbed her, and carried her outside. We took refuge in a gazebo with interior benches beside the front driveway and waited five minutes. However, nothing occurred, and the plastic ice cream tub was partially filled with taupe-coloured sludge.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I used to watch MythBusters all the time and it references the safety protocol of waiting five minutes to see if an explosive that failed to trigger will detonate.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Don't create sparks near flammable things.
