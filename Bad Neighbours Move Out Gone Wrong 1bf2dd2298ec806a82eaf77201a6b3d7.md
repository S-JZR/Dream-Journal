# Description

I was wandering through the streets in front of my unit complex at night with my family looking for something. I peaked back at their unit from a distance and noticed them seated outside on sofas watching a movie on a TV. Not wanting to be seen coming back late, we waited for hours until they went returned inside. After randomly falling asleep I dreamt about being in bed inside my unit but a small insect bothered me by flying ovals around me.

> **Dad**: Don't fret it's just a paper light which is harmless.
**Dad**: Let Coco (my cat) try to catch it.
> 

Coco, my cat, ran around chasing it.

I woke up in the passenger seat of my mum's car parked in the garage, realizing we were still trying to stealthily get inside our unit. I switched places to the drivers seat and slowly backed out until peaking at the front doors to see they had already moved inside. I slowly moved into a parking spot.

> **Dad**: You’re using the wrong gear, change it to the one that says quiet to avoid disturbing the neighbours.
> 

I shifted the gear, making the engine almost inaudible. After failing to park between the white lines twice, my dad got annoyed and took over.

Upon entering our unit, I quickly realized that none of the items inside were ours despite key furniture being arranged in the same way and mum agreed. A cardboard sign on a door in the back stated that everything had been temporarily moved for renovations. After passing through a side door, I emerged into the interior of a large rectangular factory with a wooden replica of the first floor of my unit, including the staircase, was mounted on a turntable. It rotated while walking walking inside and ascending the stairs to explore. A stream of paint was released behind me, turning the interior walls dark blue, but it missed me because I kept moving forward, though I was unsure what the noise was and initially thought it was compressed air.

We exited into a shopping mall and followed an underground footpath to a spacious side car park. I was wary of an old man possibly creeping up behind me and walked beside my parents to warn them.

> **Parents**: He’s probably just a normal guy.
> 

The man walked away. The neighbours approached us as the daughter cried.

> **Daughter**: I lost the spare $150 that you gave for my bill as I mistakenly typed the wrong account number at the bank because I used the clock time.
> 

She noticed a package that I was holding containing individually wrapped packets.

> **Daughter**: Can I have one?
**Me**: No.
> 

We both sat on ski lifts that took us through a shopping mall until realizing they got off before the end. I opened the packets to discover they contained valuable electronics and realized the neighbours were scheming to steal from us.

When returning to a tall hotel, I instinctively knew the neighbours were also staying there.

> **Me**: We need to check out early to escape potential danger.
**Parents**: We’re not in a hurry because there are no refunds.
> 

My parents got into a fight with staff at the reception desk.

> **Mum**: I just want to let you know the neighbours are untrustworthy and dangerous.
**Staff**: There’s nothing wrong with them.
**Staff**: They helped make the restaurant food taste good.
> 

After being rebuked, my parents repeatedly walked in an oval to think of an argument and return to say something until giving up.

> **Mum**: I know why these people are so corrupt, it’s because they have an idol on their front desk, so they’re Satan worshippers.
> 

Various people, including those on the Mezzanine above, laughed at her and I felt embarrassed.
