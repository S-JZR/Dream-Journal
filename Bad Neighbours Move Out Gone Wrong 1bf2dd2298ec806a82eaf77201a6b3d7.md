# Description

My parents discussed that a neighbour was moving out. During the night, my family wandered through the streets in front of our unit complex, searching for something. I peaked back at their unit from a distance and noticed them seated outside on sofas watching a movie on a TV. Not wanting to be seen coming back late, we waited for hours until they went returned inside. After randomly falling asleep I dreamt about being in bed inside my unit but a small insect that my dad called a “paper light” bothered me by flying in ovals above me. He told me not to fret over it since it was harmless and let our cat, coco, try to catch it as she ran around. Later I woke up in the passenger seat of my mum's car parked in the garage, realizing we were still trying to stealthily get inside our unit. I switched places to the drivers seat and slowly backed out until peaking at the front doors to see they had already moved inside. While slowly manoeuvring into a parking spot my dad said “You’re using the wrong gear, change it to the one that says quiet to avoid disturbing the neighbours”. Looking down I saw a labelled option and shifted gears, causing the engine to fall to a barely inaudible rumble. After failing to park between the white lines twice, my dad got irritated and took over driving.

Upon entering our unit, I quickly realized that none of the items inside were ours despite key furniture being arranged in the same way and mum agreed. A cardboard sign on a door in the back stated that everything had been temporarily moved for renovations. After passing through a side door, I emerged into the interior of a large rectangular factory with a wooden replica of the first floor of my unit, including the staircase, was mounted on a turntable. It rotated while walking walking inside and ascending the stairs to explore. A stream of paint was released behind me, turning the interior walls dark blue, but it missed me because I kept moving forward, though I was unsure what the noise was and initially thought it was compressed air.

We exited the construction site into a shopping mall and followed an underground footpath to a spacious side car park. Wary of an old man possibly trying to creep up behind me, I walked alongside my parents to warn them. However, they dismissed it saying he’s probably just a normal guy and he deviated elsewhere. The neighbours walked past as the daughter cried that she lost the spare $150 we gave her for a bill due to mistakenly entering the wrong account number at the bank by using the clock time. Noticing a package that had randomly appeared in my hands with individually containing individually wrapped sealed packets, she asked to have one but I refused. We both sat on ski lifts that took us through a shopping mall until realizing they were not at the end. After discovering the packets contained valuable electronics, we realized they were scheming to take our money.

When returning to a tall hotel, I instinctively knew the neighbours were also staying there, so I told my parents to check out early to escape potential danger. However, they weren’t in a hurry due to the lack of refunds. I kept urging them to focus on checking out, but they got into a fight with reception over complaints about the neighbours but they didn’t believe them. I thought it was silly until it became clear they were in on it as the reception defended the neighbours by claiming they helped make the restaurant food taste good. After being rebuked, my parents repeatedly walked in an oval, taking turns to come back and say something. Mum said “I know why these people are so corrupt, it’s because they have an idol on their front desk, so they’re Satan worshippers.” This made various people laugh including those on the Mezzanine above. Since the dream was so long, I reflected on everything that occurred and noted the three key plots. I was annoyed about my parents taking their time since I had to remember all these details.
