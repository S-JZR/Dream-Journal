# Description

I was wandering through the streets in front of my unit complex at night with my family looking for something. I peaked back at their unit from a distance and noticed them seated outside on sofas watching a movie on a TV. Not wanting to be seen coming back late, we waited for hours until they went returned inside. After randomly falling asleep I dreamt about being in bed inside my unit but a small insect bothered me by flying ovals around me.

> **Dad**: Don't fret it's just a paper light which is harmless.
**Dad**: Let Coco (my cat) try to catch it.
> 

Coco, my cat, ran around chasing it.

I woke up in the passenger seat of my mum's car parked in the garage, realizing we were still trying to stealthily get inside our unit. I switched places to the drivers seat and slowly backed out until peaking at the front doors to see they had already moved inside. I slowly moved into a parking spot.

> **Dad**: You’re using the wrong gear, change it to the one that says quiet to avoid disturbing the neighbours.
> 

I shifted the gear, making the engine almost inaudible. After failing to park between the white lines twice, my dad got annoyed and took over.

Upon entering our unit, I quickly realized that none of the items inside were ours despite key furniture being arranged in the same way and mum agreed. A cardboard sign on a door in the back stated that everything had been temporarily moved for renovations. After passing through a side door, I emerged into the interior of a large rectangular factory with a wooden replica of the first floor of my unit, including the staircase, was mounted on a turntable. It rotated while walking walking inside and ascending the stairs to explore. A stream of paint was released behind me, turning the interior walls dark blue, but it missed me because I kept moving forward, though I was unsure what the noise was and initially thought it was compressed air.

We exited into a shopping mall and followed an underground footpath to a spacious side car park. I was wary of an old man possibly creeping up behind me and walked beside my parents to warn them.

> **Parents**: He’s probably just a normal guy.
> 

The man walked away. The neighbours approached us as the daughter cried.

> **Daughter**: I lost the spare $150 that you gave for my bill as I mistakenly typed the wrong account number at the bank because I used the clock time.
> 

She noticed a package that I was holding containing individually wrapped packets.

> **Daughter**: Can I have one?
**Me**: No.
> 

We both sat on ski lifts that took us through a shopping mall until realizing they got off before the end. I opened the packets to discover they contained valuable electronics and realized the neighbours were scheming to steal from us.

When returning to a tall hotel, I instinctively knew the neighbours were also staying there.

> **Me**: We need to check out early to escape potential danger.
**Parents**: We’re not in a hurry because there are no refunds.
> 

My parents got into a fight with staff at the reception desk.

> **Mum**: I just want to let you know the neighbours are untrustworthy and dangerous.
**Staff**: There’s nothing wrong with them.
**Staff**: They helped make the restaurant food taste good.
> 

After being rebuked, my parents repeatedly walked in an oval to think of an argument and return to say something until giving up.

> **Mum**: I know why these people are so corrupt, it’s because they have an idol on their front desk, so they’re Satan worshippers.
> 

Various people, including those on the Mezzanine above, laughed at her and I felt embarrassed.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experience:
    - Since last year we had bad neighbours move in that were the worst we’ve ever had to deal with that never accepted advice, constantly yelled at each other with poor family relationships, had no regard for noise, and manipulated to get their way.
    - When learning to drive in the past, my dad would tell me to switch off the lights and engine when returning to the carpark in the unit complex to avoid disturbing the neighbours.
    - I constantly struggle to park between the lines.

## Symbols

- Insect:
    - My mum got overly upset by the neighbours but I didn’t let it bother me.
- Paint:
    - Problems that others are trying to force upon me.
- Cycle Arguments:
    - I dislike people who engage in endless petty arguments just to prove they’re right.
- Idol:
    - My mum occasionally says foolish things or sweeping statements that make me cringe or unsure what to think about it.

## Lessons

- Control your emotions and don't let every negative event provoke a reaction.

# Pre Dream

- My mum said the neighbours were officially moving out and put their property on the market.

# Post Dream

- Possibly predicted the neighbours demanding money from another neighbour over suspicious circumstances about seven months later. [Classified for now].
