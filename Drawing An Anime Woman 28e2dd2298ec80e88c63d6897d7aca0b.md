# Description

I was seated on a stainless steel bench beside the hall of my secondary school, holding an A4 sketchpad. I drew a detailed anime style pencil shaded portrait of a young adult Asian woman with long hair, smooth traditional clothes with a subtle floral design, small breasts, and a neutral slightly sad expression.
