# Description

The commercial used a vlog style and featured various shots zooming in on the store from afar and capturing diverse customers walking in.

I was one of many actors portraying scientists in a burger king commercial where we conducted a secret investigation to determine whether the burgers were truly better than other brands. We gathered samples and concluded that 7 out of 10 people preferred Burger King. However, we soon realized we had been accidentally filming at a McDonald's.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I saw a Vanish Napisan commercial where scientists in lab coats were testing various cleaning products in a line of washing machines to show that Napisan was the best.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Challenge assumptions and verify details early to prevent costly fixes later.
