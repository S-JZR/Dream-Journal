# Description

The commercial used a vlog style and featured various shots zooming in on the store from afar and capturing diverse customers walking in.

I was one of many actors portraying scientists in a burger king commercial where we conducted a secret investigation to determine whether the burgers were truly better than other brands. We gathered samples and concluded that 7 out of 10 people preferred Burger King. However, we soon realized we had been accidentally filming at a McDonald's.
