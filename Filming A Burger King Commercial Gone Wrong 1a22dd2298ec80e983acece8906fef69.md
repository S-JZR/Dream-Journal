# Description

While filming a Burger King commercial about scientists conducting an independent investigation to ascertain whether the burgers were truly superior to other brands. Through obtaining samples and gathering data, it concluded that 7 out of 10 people preferred Burger King. The visual style of the footage adopted a vlog-style approach, featuring various shots zooming in on the store from afar, capturing diverse customers walking in. However, while continuing production onsite, a genuine realization struck us that we were inadvertently filming at the wrong location revealed to be McDonald's.
