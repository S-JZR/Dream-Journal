# Description

I was standing on the footpath outside my unit complex when I noticed two small twin girls with green skin nearby starring at me. They explained how they anticipated meeting me where I stood during the same time next year. As they wandered away down the street, I began following them to inquire about what they meant and where they were going. However, they soon blended into a crowd of adults boarding a mini white bus.

Upon returning to the unit complex entrance, a sign appeared with a live preference poll for angel and devil biscuits, with many voting that the latter tasted better. Suddenly, a sepia horror film was projected onto the right wooden fence surrounding the property, depicting giant fungi tentacle monsters trying to eat people, but one was faster and did not have the capacity to consume, so they passed directly through it. As night fell, enveloping surroundings in pitch blackness, I grew paranoid that the girls were luring me outside for something sinister, prompting me to flee into my unit. I relayed the entire scenario to my brother, who jokingly remarked that they sounded like they were straight out of “The Shining”.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I have watched snippets of The Shinning and know that the twins were murdered by their father.
- I hear Christian teachings all the time and it reminds me of 1 Peter 5:8 and that God is gentle and patient but Satan is aggressive and actively tempts.

## Symbols

- The Twins: represents how evil can infiltrate and destroy innocence.
- Devil biscuits: humanity is inclined to follow sinful lusts over God.
- Monsters: God and Satan fighting for people’s allegiance.

## Lessons

- Society promotes sin as fun and harmless.

# Post Dream

- From what I’m aware, nothing notable occurred on the same day a year later.
