# Description

I was standing on the footpath outside my unit complex when I noticed two small twin girls with green skin nearby starring at me. They explained how they anticipated meeting me where I stood during the same time next year. As they wandered away down the street, I began following them to inquire about what they meant and where they were going. However, they soon blended into a crowd of adults boarding a mini white bus.

Upon returning to the unit complex entrance, a sign appeared with a live preference poll for angel and devil biscuits, with many voting that the latter tasted better. Suddenly, a sepia horror film was projected onto the right wooden fence surrounding the property, depicting giant fungi tentacle monsters trying to eat people, but one was faster and did not have the capacity to consume, so they passed directly through it. As night fell, enveloping surroundings in pitch blackness, I grew paranoid that the girls were luring me outside for something sinister, prompting me to flee into my unit. I relayed the entire scenario to my brother, who jokingly remarked that they sounded like they were straight out of “The Shining”.
