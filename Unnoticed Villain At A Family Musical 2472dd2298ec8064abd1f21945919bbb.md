# Description

I was standing in a church service for a Christmas family musical with my family but we decided to go somewhere else after remembering how awful it was last year. I asked my parents where my brother was so we could leave and my dad said he was upstairs. While outside my dad asked if we wanted to go to IKEA for a hotdog and I enthusiastically said yes. Suddenly, I was playing the role of a villain wearing black on the stage. There was a twist that I was present in every scene but nobody noticed since I was standing idle to the side and facing away until the last one when I confronted the characters.
