# Description

I was in a black void, talking to the disembodied voice of a female therapist.

> **Therapist**: How are you coping emotionally with the loss your cat, Jayba?
**Me**: I feel a bit disappointed that I didn’t cry much for someone that was a big part of my life but I’m comfortable moving on with a strange sense of confidence.
**Me**: It’s not because I don’t care about her but I've accepted what happened.
**Therapist**: That’s okay. Everyone handles emotions differently.
