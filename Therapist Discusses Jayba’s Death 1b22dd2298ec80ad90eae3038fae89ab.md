# Description

I was in a black void, talking to the disembodied voice of a female therapist.

> **Therapist**: How are you coping emotionally with the loss your cat, Jayba?
> 

> **Me**: I feel a bit disappointed that I didn’t cry much for someone that was a big part of my life but I’m comfortable moving on with a strange sense of confidence.
> 

> **Me**: It’s not because I don’t care about her but I've accepted what happened.
> 

> **Therapist**: That’s okay, everyone handles emotions differently.
