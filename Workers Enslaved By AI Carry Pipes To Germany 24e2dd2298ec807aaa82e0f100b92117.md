# Description

I was with my family in a remote area when we saw multiple lines of people in sky blue uniforms carrying 30 metre long straight white pipes above their heads as they walked across a highway and entered from a nearby joining ramp. I said this looks like something straight out of 1984 and we ascended onto the highway which transformed into a red/brown brick tunnel. An AI female voice over a speaker instructed us to pickup a pipe on the ground but we were the only ones there and the front was tilting down so a robotic arm on the ceiling temporarily lifted it. She said if you’re new then carry the pipe beside your hip [to reduce arm strain]. Various other people joined in and we made a long journey across a dirt path to deliver the pipe to a traditional German town at night.
