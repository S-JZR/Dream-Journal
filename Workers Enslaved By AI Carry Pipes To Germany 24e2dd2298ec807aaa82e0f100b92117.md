# Description

I was walking in a remote area with my family when we saw multiple lines of people in sky blue uniforms carrying 30-metre-long white pipes above their heads across a highway, some were already on it and others were joining from side ramps. I said this looks like something straight out of 1984 and we ascended onto the highway which transformed into a red/brown brick tunnel. An AI female voice over a speaker instructed us to pickup a pipe on the ground but we were the only ones there and the front was tilting down so a robotic arm on the ceiling temporarily lifted it. She said if you’re new then carry the pipe beside your hip to reduce arm strain. Various other people joined in and we made a long journey across a dirt path to deliver the pipe to a traditional German town at night.

- Mad God:
    - References a cyborg dictator oppressing synthetic grey workers. I feel it’s like Nazism.
