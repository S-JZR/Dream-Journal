# Description

I was one of many passengers seated on a white tour bus ascending a somewhat abandoned ten-storey carpark with an elevator, graffiti, and trash piled in a few spots. Upon arriving at the top, we dismounted into a hotel where I went into a room with my mum. The room featured a warm industrial theme with earth colours, a brown table with a rectangular dental kit on it, creamy walls, and a brick wall at the front with a black plasma TV mounted on it.

I opened the dental kit to find a thick forest-green toothbrush with a translucent handle and timer, and skimmed the instruction manual. It mentioned the room could capture X-rays but I wasn’t sure if it was done by the toothbrush or the camera hole beside the TV. When activating the toothbrush, it audibly started counting down from 10 seconds and the handle flashed yellow then red, so I switched it off, afraid of being exposed to radiation.

Eventually, my mum discovered that the X-rays were taken beside the TV by flicking on a switch that showed whatever was in front of the camera hole on the screen and pressing the start button to capture an image of bones in her hand. She told me to have a look but I was too squeamish. After she took multiple images, I told her to stop, fearing radiation poisoning.

As everyone boarded the bus again, it started descended the car park. However, halfway down a female passenger yelled that she forgot her wallet and a man rhetorically said, “What!?” I told her she could get it herself after we reached the bottom.
