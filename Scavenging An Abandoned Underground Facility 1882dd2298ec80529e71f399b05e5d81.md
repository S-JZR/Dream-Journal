# Description

I was one of five scavengers on a square cargo spaceship with a flat top:

- Left: rectangular barbecue.
- Centre: LED paper lantern.
- Right: work desk and a half-sized dumpster.
- Front: steering wheel.
- Perimeter: wooden stockade fence.

Our descent led to a snowy underground facility with three entrances forming a C-formation, where we began collecting various pieces of cardboard and aluminium cans. A pack of ravenous wolves ambushed the location, attempting to breach it. Extending a javelin deterred one wolf, understanding that approaching would result in injury as it brushed against the tip, prompting its retreat as I sealed the front door. While moving towards the left door, covered by a chain-linked fence, another wolf burst through abruptly, attempting to bite my arm. Employing the same tactic, we sealed off that entrance and deployed sentries at each door to prevent further breaches while we continued working.

As everything settled, we ventured deeper into the facility through a series of straight hallways until entering a central cave chamber with a pathway running alongside a river of lava illuminating the atmosphere. Amid the shadows behind shipment crates, we encountered multiple deranged cats infected with a zombie virus, tasked with eliminating them. However, as we neared completion, one pounced from behind, scratching my arms. Retreating to the hallway, I instinctively smeared sanitizing gel across the emerging welts, effectively averting the infection.

I was in a hospital leaning on two crutches as a female receptionist directed me through the front swinging doors toward a treatment area. However, a woman in the prior room growled and convulsed so everyone scattered. A staff member urgently instructed me to secure the locks on my side. Frantically looking around, all I could find were comedically small barrel bolt locks placed atop and below the doors.

Returning to the ship at midnight, the central lantern illuminated the space as everyone gathered around one crew member cooking sausages on a barbecue. Eventually, multiple strangers were spotted lurking in the nearby woods, glowing from a campfire. As a precaution, the light was deactivated, and the pilot began to ascend, suggesting we should evacuate due to the potential risk. However, I rebutted to wait until we clear out the equipment and loot below to avoid unnecessary losses and wasting our invested time. A crew member volunteered to make multiple trips, carrying items up to the ship, while the ladder was dropped and a spotlight illuminated the area below, aiding their work. While reminding them to collect the indoor sentries, a pair of glowing eyes appeared in the dark, revealed to be a wolf. We instructed them to come up immediately since the situation was becoming overly hazardous, then departed to another location, gliding over trees.
