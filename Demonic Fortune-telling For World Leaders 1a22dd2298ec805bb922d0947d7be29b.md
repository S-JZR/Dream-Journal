# Description

While seated beside a demonic figure at a table there were three world representatives on the opposite side. Spread across the surface were numerous A4 and A3 white pages with symbolic children’s drawings as we engaged in an elite fortune-telling session to inquire about the world’s future. While attempting to discard a poorer quality drawing, I felt an energetic deep vibration emanating from the demon, prompting me to make a request before proceeding, as everything felt calm again. Assigned the task of organizing the drawings in order, I found it increasingly challenging, as a few of my seventh-grade creations were thrown into the mix, compounded by the limited space on my narrow area of the table.
