# Description

I was seated at a table in a dark room beside a demon, performing an elite fortune-telling session for three world leaders seated on the opposite side, using my A4 and A3 childhood drawings scattered across the table. While attempting to discard a poorer quality drawing, I felt an energetic deep vibration emanating from the demon, prompting me to make a request before proceeding, as everything felt calm again. Assigned the task of organizing the drawings in order, I found it increasingly challenging, as a few of my seventh-grade creations were thrown into the mix, compounded by the limited space on my narrow area of the table.
