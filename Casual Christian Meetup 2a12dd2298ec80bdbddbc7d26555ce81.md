# Description

I was standing in the lounge room of my unit with my family when three young Christian adults came over to chat. After hearing a noisy motorbike, I looked out the kitchen window to see Bryce Crawford driving a noisy red motorbike down and up the alleyway behind the units before parking beside the footpath. Everyone moved to unit 7 for a discussion. A woman was wearing a red dress. Bryce was wearing a Walking Dead T-shirt with grey zombies crawling on the ground.

> **Mum**: What kind of Christian would watch the Walking Dead?
> 

> **Bryce**: It’s all fictional.
> 

> **Me**: That’s irrelevant.
> 

> **Bryce**: Zombies in media can be created by different means including the natural and supernatural.
> 

> **Woman**: I’m going to the store down the road and I’ll be right back.
> 

> **Me**: Don’t go alone since there’s been iffy things happening in the street lately.
> 

> **Man**: Yes especially since woman are a weaker vessel and someone could take advantage of her.
> 

Two men escorted her to the store.
