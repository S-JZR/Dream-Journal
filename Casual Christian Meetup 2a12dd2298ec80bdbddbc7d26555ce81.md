# Description

I was standing in the lounge room of my unit when a few young Christian adults came over to chat. After hearing a noisy motorbike, I looked out the kitchen window to see Bryce Crawford driving a noisy red motorbike down and up the alleyway behind the units before parking beside the footpath. Everyone moved to unit 7 for a discussion.

- Bryce was wearing a Walking Dead T-shirt with grey zombies crawling on the ground.

> **Mum**: what kind of Christian would watch the Walking Dead?
**Bryce**: it’s all fictional.
**Me**: that’s irrelevant.
**Bryce**: zombies in media can be created by different means including the natural and supernatural.
> 
- Woman was wearing a red dress.

> **Woman**: I’m going to the store down the road and I’ll be right back.
**Me**: don’t go alone since there’s been iffy things happening in the street lately.
**Man**: yes especially since woman are a weaker vessel and someone could take advantage of her.
> 

Two men then escorted her to the store.
