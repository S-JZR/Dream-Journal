# Description

I was walking into my unit complex when I noticed a deformed white fluffy creature laying down on its belly in front of my garage. It began to stand up upon noticing me and initially resembled a camel pulling its long crossed legs out from loose floor gutters but morphed into a dog with an abnormally long and wide black nose as it walked towards me. As it tried to sniff me, I pushed it away with my foot.

Soon an elderly woman with white hair appeared, recognising my brother and I had been actors in the dream and invited us back to a hub where others from various shows were being reunited for a special event. When I asked who sent this request, she said the actors from Friends were thrilled about seeing us. Realizing I had no associations with them, I expressed my distrust, but she commanded the creature to attack which pinned me down by wrapping its claws around my legs and trying to bite me as struggled to push its head away.

While crying out for my brother to help he opened the wooden door to look through the fly screen with a bewildered expression. I explained that both the woman and creature were crazy and assaulting me. After exiting the unit to break me free we quickly fled inside and locked both doors. Eventually, my brother peaked through the kitchen blinds on the other side of the unit and yelled in terror "holy s**t she's trying to break into the upstairs room by using the animal to ascend the wall!” then I woke up in fear.
