# Description

I was one of a few hunters dispatched to kill a white yeti in tall rocky terrain with some trees and flat areas. With a few minutes to build structures, we sought to secure a vantage point on the left side of symmetrical split paths that arced upwards to the same elevated pathway in front of a mountain. After setting up various tall and short corrugated metal sheets to barricade the inner side of the path we quickly realized the yeti could climb over them, so we fled ahead while placing walls to hinder its pursuit. For some reason, a mind control facility protruded from the mountain, which I accessed by super-jumping to the top to activate transmissions that repelled the yeti.
