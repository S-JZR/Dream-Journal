# Description

Framed for a crime by Mrs Tweedy from Chicken Run, I skilfully evaded the pursuing police in a high-speed car chase, steering onto the road that led to the zoo. In a daring move, I took a drastic turn, inadvertently clipping a small stone monument that propelled me airborne, soaring over the closed fence before crash-landing on the other side.

Suddenly, I transformed into Woody from Toy Story and sought refuge in a strategic hiding spot. I burrowed myself within one of many elevated rectangular gardening beds, meticulously ensuring every part of my body was concealed in the soil. However, my attempt at eluding capture faced a new challenge when one of the astute police captains urged everyone in their search to scrutinize the details of everything they pass. Detaching a small water distribution pipe, he keenly overheard the sound of my shallow breathing, making sure it was separate from the search party. Acknowledging the inevitability of capture, I swiftly leaped onto the ground, darting into nearby shrubbery.
