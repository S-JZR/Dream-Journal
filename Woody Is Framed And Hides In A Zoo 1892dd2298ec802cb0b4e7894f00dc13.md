# Description

I was Woody from Toy Story who was framed by Mrs Tweedy from Chicken Run and evaded police in a high-speed chase by turning off the road and clipping a small stone monument to launch myself over the fence of a zoo. I sprinted further into the zoo and tried to hide by burying myself in one of many elevated rectangular garden beds. However, my attempt at eluding capture faced a new challenge when one of the astute police captains urged everyone in their search to scrutinize the details of everything they pass. Detaching a small water distribution pipe, he keenly overheard the sound of my shallow breathing, making sure it was separate from the search party. Acknowledging the inevitability of capture, I swiftly leaped onto the ground, darting into nearby shrubbery.
