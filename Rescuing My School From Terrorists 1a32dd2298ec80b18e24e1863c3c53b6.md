# Description

I was wandering the lower field beside the year five block at my primary school when camouflaged soldiers emerged from the forest. They scolded everyone for being out of bounds and directed us to the upper field. While repeatedly glancing over my shoulder, I accidentally bumped into the tip of a black jousting pole held by a male soldier. He looked bewildered before grumbling, "What are you doing?" Embarrassed, I ignored him and kept walking. Gunfire erupted ahead as a crowd on the oval turned towards the sports hall, now a multi-storey structure. Instinctively, I took cover behind a line of trees left of the oval with other students and inquired about the situation. They explained that armed terrorists had stormed the building and were fighting the military. Bullets occasionally whizzed past, thudding as they struck the surroundings. I sprinted between trees, pressing against each trunk and student until I reached cover behind the admin office.

Determined to support the soldiers, I embarked on a solo mission to liberate the school. I donned a bulletproof vest and armed myself with a shotgun fitted with a drum magazine. To avoid misidentification, I carried a small Australian flag. I tried to place the flag between the straps of my vest to free up my hands, but it kept falling, so I held it instead. Passing through an archway between classrooms, I shouted "National Guard!" and raised the flag in my fist. Entering the hall, I encountered a group of people frozen in fear. Initially, I thought it was because of my gear, but then I realized my flag had slipped off the stick, making it look like I was raising a rebel fist. After an awkward pause, I ascended the stairs to the electrical room. I kicked open the door with my gun raised to reveal a narrow concrete room with a yellow power box in the centre. The opposite door led to a hallway adorned with a crimson carpet and walnut wainscoting.

As I ascended the stairwell, a grotesque alien in a wheelchair struggled to exit. While sympathetically reaching out to turn the doorknob, it scolded me to open the door. I quickly opened it to let them through. However, as I turned around, two other aliens were waiting, one in a wheelchair and the other swiftly crawling up the stairs without legs. They aggressively demanded that I open the door and move aside. For some reason, I snapped and shot them both in the head with my shotgun. Wandering through the hallway, I found a room full of aliens and shot at them with all my shotgun and pistol ammo.

I travelled back in time and returned to the electrical room where I heard the voices of four male terrorists echoing through the halls. I crept into the room, pressed myself against the yellow power box, and peeked around the right side to shoot one in the head. I quickly moved to the other side and eliminated another. As the remaining terrorists realized someone had infiltrated, they raised their weapons and cautiously approached. Navigating around the power box, I shot one in the back of the head as they turned the corner. The last survivor dropped his gun and offered to surrender. I instructed him to raise his hands and secured them with cable ties.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I used to watch SpongeBob SquarePants a lot as a child and the aliens probably reference Baby Prunes who is bad-tempered and going deaf [https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Prunes](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Prunes). They also probably reference the video game trope of shooting evil monsters.

## Symbols

- Fighting terrorists: feeling angry at injustice and desiring to stop it before anyone is harmed.
- Terror attack: the fear of experiencing a tragedy in a previously safe location.
