# Description

While seated at a round table covered in a white silk cloth in a fancy restaurant, a misunderstanding arose regarding a request for a blank piece of paper to jot down orders. The waiter then offered to sell the restaurant's merchandise, like a blank journal, providing an order form and pencil. Politely declining, another staff member approached, presenting a spoon with five tiny spherical beads in its bowl. They requested that I leave a review using a 5-point scale by clicking one of the beads with the pencil, which changed colour upon selection.

# Interpretations

## Lessons
