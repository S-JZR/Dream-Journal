# Description

I was seated at a round table covered in a white silk cloth in a fancy restaurant with a male waiter nearby.

> **Me**: Can I please have a blank piece of paper to jot down my order?
**Waiter**: We do sell journals if you would like one.
> 

He handed me an order form and a pencil.

> **Me**: No thanks.
> 

A waitress approached and gave me a spoon with a line of five tiny beads in its bowl.

> **Waitress**: If you have the time could you leave a review by pressing a bead in this spoon.
> 

I pressed a bead with my pencil and the beads corresponding to the rating glowed red.
