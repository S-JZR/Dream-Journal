# Description

I was standing with a crowd in the open space on the second highest floor of a multi-story concrete building with parapets between square pillars along the perimeter. After mingling for some time, cockroaches began raining down from the roof onto the floor, causing everyone to move away in panic. Some of us went to the stairs but they were were also infested with cockroaches crawling out from the lower levels. Many ascended to the top floor where they climbed over the parapets and proceeded to the end of a large L-shaped roof made of corrugated metal. However, after those in front, including myself, realized it led to a sharp drop we immediately tuned back and instructed others to do the same to avoid being pushed off.

Noticing many short and tall blue plastic buckets stacked against a central wall on the previous level, I filled one with water to wash away the cockroaches on the lower staircase. A father and son were also trying to get a bucket and when I took a smaller one he was briefly annoyed but I explained he could have one of the larger ones. After teaming up with two men and two women we descended into a hallway on the lower level and entered a side room divided by a green translucent glass wall and door covered in detailed instructions about how to handle acid. While inside two cockroaches had rapidly evolved to be 12 inches tall, stand on their legs, and talk. They began insulting everyone and spat a few drops of green acid onto the shirts of the women who were closest to them. One of the annoyed women scolded them to not do it again but it did so she shot it in the head as it lifelessly fell to the ground. I warned the women to dilute the acid by dabbing their shirts with water and avoid soaking it through to their skin.

Eventually, after hearing rumours that this entire incident was an experiment gone wrong, one of the men visited the house of an elderly woman associated with the project, a few blocks away, to question her. However, she seemed crazy and slid a card under the door with the alphabet written on six lines with a few letters marked with dotted underlines.
