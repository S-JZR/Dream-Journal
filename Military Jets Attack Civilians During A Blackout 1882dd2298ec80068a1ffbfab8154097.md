# Description

I was waiting in line at the checkouts in a Coles supermarket within a retail strip when an unexpected blackout occurred.

> **Me**: (To cashier) You should check if the neighbouring ALDI is also affected.

She walked out the front door to investigate and didn't return so I left the store. A riot erupted outside, drawing a multitude of people to the carpark, which gradually transformed into a grassy field. Suddenly, a military jet soared overhead, circling before nose-diving toward the crowd, unleashing a torrent of bullets from its side Vulcan guns. Fearing being struck in the head, I barely managed to flee beneath a nearby awning extending across all stores when a series of loud thuds reverberated, impacting miscellaneous areas of terrain.

Determined to cease the unfolding tragedy, I traversed along the perimeter of a fence elevated above a dirt road until reaching a military base with the intention of infiltrating it. However, upon witnessing a series of next generation jets activate their lights and drive down the road I concealed myself behind a tree on the hill with my back firmly pressed against the fence. A woman below noticed me.

> **Woman**: Stop looking at me!

As night fell and all aircraft cleared the area, I retraced my steps to flee the area.
