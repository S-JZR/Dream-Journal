# Description

I was with various students and teachers from my secondary school in a three storey wooden rectangular atrium with concrete pillars and a concrete ground floor. The upper levels were off-limits due to limited staff supervision. A few students forwarded to a nearby hall to prepare for a performance, and the teachers asked everyone to open their laptops and perform an online vote for who they wanted to hear sing.

An indoor television displayed all the students onstage and as the camera transitioned to each individual, a rapper name was overlayed, some inappropriate, and everyone cheered to show their level of admiration. However, I couldn’t be bothered getting a laptop from the trolley and wasn’t overly fussed with the event. I walked around looking for loose coins and encountered a few but others picked them up before me.
