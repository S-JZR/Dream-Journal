# Description

I stood in the car park of my unit complex under the moonlight as the ground trembled and the distant sound of soldiers marching up the street grew louder. Instinctively aware that a curfew was in effect, I hurried back inside and locked the door as multiple of them passed by to ensure the area was secure.
