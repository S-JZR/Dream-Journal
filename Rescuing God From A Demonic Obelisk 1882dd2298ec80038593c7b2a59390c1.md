# Description

I was walking through the countryside with Michael and Dejan, friends from secondary school, when a distant explosion rapidly engulfed the entire sky in a wave of flames until everything became pitch black.

> **Michael**: What in the world just happened?
> 

> **Dejan**: We need to get back to the city.
> 

We returned to a part of the city and saw:

- Left:
    - Overpass leading outside the city with wooden crates scattered across it.
- Forward:
    - Dimensional rift outside the city revealing God seated on a throne illuminated by a golden aurora behind him. A giant frozen circular wooden and gold clock levitated to his right.
    - Mountains.
- Right:
    - Tall demonic black obelisk with a female voice and a diamond-shaped block on top with a glowing red eye that emitted a white spotlight.
    - Small apartment buildings.

What happened was that demons froze God in a time stasis to rule the world indefinitely. The obelisk acted as a taskmaster, monitoring everything and forcing everyone it saw, including us, to perform forced labour around it.

> **Obelisk**: You three, come here and get to work immediately!
> 

I was determined to rescue God to liberate the world, so while the obelisk wasn't looking I fled across the bridge and hid behind the crates. However, the obelisk had a good memory and quickly noticed my absence. I instinctively knew its eye could shoot a death ray to instantly kill anyone.

> **Obelisk**: If you don't return in the next 30 seconds then I will start executing your friends!
> 

After hurrying to the other side, I set the clock back in motion to free God who restored order to the world.

    - I often hear Atheists accuse God of being evil for annihilating unrepentant locations as a judgement. I’ve always wondered what would happen if God never intervened to stop evil.

## Symbols

- Obelisk:
    - Ancient idolatry and sin.
- God Frozen:
    - I’ve always struggled with believing in God and feel like he’s absent.
