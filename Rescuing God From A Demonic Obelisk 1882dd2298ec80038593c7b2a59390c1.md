# Description

While strolling in the countryside during the day with some secondary school friends, an explosion suddenly erupted in the distance, engulfing the sky in a wave of flames until it was completely black. Uncertain about what had occurred, we returned to the city only to find it monitored by a towering black obelisk with a small red eye protruding from a diamond-shaped block at its apex. It scanned the streets with a spotlight and forced crowds to perform forced labour.

Beyond distant buildings, a dimensional rift lay open, revealing God seated on a throne, illuminated by a golden aurora, with a giant stationary clock beside him. The clock held him in a time stasis, allowing demonic entities to rule the world indefinitely.

Determined to rescue God, I navigated across an elevated highway, hiding behind wooden crates distributed across it while the obelisk was distracted. Upon noticing my absence, it threatened to execute random people if I didn't quickly return. After hurrying to the other side, I set the clock back in motion, allowing God to liberate the world.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I hear people all the time accuse God of being evil for judging unrepentant locations by annihilating them and I’ve always wondered what would happen if he didn’t intervene and demons were allowed to rule the world.
- I’ve always struggled with believing in God and feel like he’s absent.

## Symbols

- Obelisk: ancient idolatry and evil that is revived.

## Lessons

- The world would be a worse place if evil was never judged.
