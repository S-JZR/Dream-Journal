# Description

I was walking through the countryside with Michael and Dejan, friends from secondary school, when a distant explosion occurred that engulfed the entire sky in a wave of flames until everything became pitch black. Uncertain about what had occurred, we returned to the city only to find it monitored by a towering black obelisk with a small red eye protruding from a diamond-shaped block at its apex. It scanned the streets with a spotlight and forced crowds to perform forced labour.

Beyond distant buildings, a dimensional rift lay open, revealing God seated on a throne, illuminated by a golden aurora, with a giant stationary clock beside him. The clock held him in a time stasis, allowing demonic entities to rule the world indefinitely.

Determined to rescue God, I navigated across an elevated highway, hiding behind wooden crates distributed across it while the obelisk was distracted. Upon noticing my absence, it threatened to execute random people if I didn't quickly return. After hurrying to the other side, I set the clock back in motion, allowing God to liberate the world.

    - Ancient idolatry, sin, and corruption.

    - I’ve always struggled with believing in God and feel like he’s absent.
