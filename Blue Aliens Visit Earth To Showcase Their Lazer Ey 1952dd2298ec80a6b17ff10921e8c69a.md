# Description

Blue humanoid aliens visited Earth to showcase their ability to control their minds and emit lasers from their eyes but they couldn't do it for long since it would drain all their body's energy. In the city an individual closely observed an alien's eyes which resembled a flower stigma that opened as the entire eye emitted light like a torch but they abruptly stopped before completing the process to avoid causing harm. In a concrete room under construction without a roof, I assumed the perspective of an alien when someone asked me to chop a soda can in half that was lying on the ground near the far wall and with one swift motion I emitted a green laser to slice it in half.
