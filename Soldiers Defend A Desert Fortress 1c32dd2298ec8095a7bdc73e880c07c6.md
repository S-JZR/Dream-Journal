# Description

I was with a squad of soldiers in the desert lying prone with rifles about 100 metres away from our walled concrete fortress. An enemy squad was also lying prone in the distance. With each shot exchanged, we gradually adjusted our aim for greater accuracy as puffs of sand erupted around nearby from incoming bullets.

Eventually, a radio transmission from HQ ordered us to retreat into the fortress due to an impending enemy invasion. As we stood on the parapet walkway, a black enemy tank approached to burst through the front gate and advance further down the streets.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I used to play Team Fortress 2 a lot and this likely references the Mann Vs Machine gamemode where a tank rams through wooden gates.
