# Description

I was one of many soldiers lying prone in the desert in front of a fortress engaged in a firefight with distant soldiers. Everyone was equipped with rifles. We gradually adjusted our aim after each shot and puffs of sand erupted nearby from incoming bullets.

> **Man**: (radio) An enemy invasion is imminent.
**Man**: (radio): All personnel must retreat into the fortress immediately.
> 

Everyone fled inside the fortress and stood on the parapet as a black enemy tank approached over the horizon, burst through the front gate, and travelled through the streets.
