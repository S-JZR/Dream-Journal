# Description

I was one of many soldiers lying prone in the desert in front of a fortress engaged in a firefight with distant soldiers. Everyone was equipped with rifles. We gradually adjusted our aim after each shot and puffs of sand erupted nearby from incoming bullets.

Eventually, a radio transmission from HQ ordered us to retreat into the fortress due to an imminent enemy invasion. As we stood on the parapet walkway, a black enemy tank burst through the front gate and travelled through the streets.

# Interpretations

- I used to play Team Fortress 2 a lot and this likely references the Mann Vs Machine gamemode where a tank rams through wooden gates.
