# Description

I was standing in McDonald's with my family and Julien, my friend from secondary school, attempting a viral exploit to get free food by ordering multiple pattyless burgers on a self-service machine. However, when my dad approached the counter to request free tomato sauce packets, the staff declined to avoid losing more money.

Julien and I eventually broke away from the group when he mentioned needing to wash his face. However, grime covered the bathroom mirrors, so he handed me his bag and stepped closer, searching for a clearer reflection.
