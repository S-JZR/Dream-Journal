# Description

My family and some secondary school friends visited McDonald's to repeat a viral free food exploit involving pattyless burgers on the self-serve machine. However, when my dad approached the counter to request free tomato sauce packets, the staff declined to avoid losing more money.

Julien and I eventually broke away from the group when he mentioned needing to wash his face. However, grime covered the bathroom mirrors, so he handed me his bag and stepped closer, searching for a clearer reflection.
