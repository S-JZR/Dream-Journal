# Description

I was walking through a rural area and ascended stairs to enter the second floor of a two-storey brick building. I navigated to an exit on the other side through a maze comprising three layers of interwoven grille catwalks in a grid suspended by chains with ladders to move between platforms. Noticing two teenage women outside in the distance, I approached to overhear one joke about throwing their wallet into the tall grass while mimicking the action as the other advised against it. However, she proceeded to follow her desires by tossing it into vegetation. I said she was a moron for considering the trivial risk that led to unnecessary challenges, forcing everyone to compensate for the consequences of her poor decision. After a few minutes of searching, we eventually found the wallet laying on grass clippings as the area was instantly mowed.
