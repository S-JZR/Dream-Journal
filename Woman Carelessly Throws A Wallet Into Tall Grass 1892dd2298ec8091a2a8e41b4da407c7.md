# Description

In a rural area, I ascended to the second floor of a two-storey brick building to navigate an interior maze comprising three layers of various interwoven rectilinear grille catwalks suspended by chains from the ceiling. A few had ladders for moving between platforms to continue the path until reaching a door on the opposite side. Noticing two teenage women outside in the distance, I approached to overhear one joke about throwing their wallet into the tall grass while mimicking the action as the other advised against it. However, she proceeded to follow her desires by tossing it into vegetation. I said she was a moron for considering the trivial risk that led to unnecessary challenges, forcing everyone to compensate for the consequences of her poor decision. After a few minutes of searching, we eventually found the wallet laying on grass clippings as the area was instantly mowed.
