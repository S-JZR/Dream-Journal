# Description

I was walking through a rural area and ascended stairs to enter the second floor of a two-storey brick building. I navigated to an exit on the other side through a maze comprising three layers of interwoven grille catwalks in a grid suspended by chains with ladders to move between platforms. After exiting I approached two teenage women in the distance as one teen pretended to throw a wallet.

> **Teen 1**: Imagine if I threw your wallet into the tall grass.
**Teen 2**: No, I don’t want to have to find it.
> 

She followed her impulses anyway and threw it into dense vegetation to amuse herself.

> **Me**: You’re a moron for not thinking and turning something trivial into an unnecessary challenge.
**Me**: Now we have to waste our time searching for it.
> 

After a few minutes, I felt it was taking too long and the grass was instantly mowed. We found the wallet lying on the clippings.
