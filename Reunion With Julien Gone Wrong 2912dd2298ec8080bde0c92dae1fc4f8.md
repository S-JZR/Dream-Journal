# Description

I was standing in a random house when I reunited with Julien, my friend from school, and greeted him. However, I felt upset because he was disinterested in me, gave a few mumbled affirmations, and returned to scrolling social media on his phone. I mentioned how my brother also spends too much time scrolling TikTok and that I would rather die then be on it all day. Julien had a concerned expression, realizing that my brother who he knew had fallen into the same habit and that I held an extreme stance against it.
