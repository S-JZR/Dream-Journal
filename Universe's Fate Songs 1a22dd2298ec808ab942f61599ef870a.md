# Description

I was spectating existential music videos about the universe’s fate.

The first song was optimistic that everyone in the future would collaborate to find a way to recover lost energy and keep the universe alive forever.

The second song was pessimistic showing various large white square markers representing stars within the solar system inevitably dying out forever with nobody able to control it.
