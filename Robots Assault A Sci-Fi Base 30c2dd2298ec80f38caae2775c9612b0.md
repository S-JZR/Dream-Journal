# Description

I was spectating various robots resembling walking walls full of ammo with two miniguns on their chests and shoulder mounted rocket launchers walking down a hilly forest and assaulting a Sci-Fi base.

A smooth humanoid robot inside the base held a gun that rapidly burst fired hundreds of rounds at the head of a different thick robot with dual machine guns for arms and a shoulder mounted rocket launcher as its head exploded.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - The wall robot was a purposefully absurd idea that I once drew in class.
    - I was considering making a videogame and drew other robots designs but I scrapped the idea because it felt generic and unoriginal, I didn’t know what I wanted, it would take too much time, and I planned more than executing. I’m glad that I didn’t pursue it.
