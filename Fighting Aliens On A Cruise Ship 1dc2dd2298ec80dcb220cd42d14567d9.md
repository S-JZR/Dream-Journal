# Description

I was with a group of survivors fleeing from different types of dark grey aliens like a fast one that ran on all-fours with long thick hind legs. We jumped onto the left side of a cruise ship deck made of wooden planks. As the aliens were about to follow, I threw a Molotov behind us to stop them and we opened fire.

A swarm of small egg-shaped aliens descended a nearby side wall so I threw a Molotov toward the front. While standing beside a series of rectangular openings to a dark room downstairs, an alien with glowing yellow eyes, long arms, and long claws swiftly pulled a teammate inside. We immediately reached in to pull them back out. Once the fire ahead cleared, we continued running along the deck.
