# Description

I was walking along a dirt path at night when I noticed the faint glow of a bonfire beside a forest. As I approached a level area with a brick wall, I caught a glimpse of a witch in a purple dress and pointed hat standing on a half-illuminated shipping container behind it to the right, likely engaged in a ritual.
