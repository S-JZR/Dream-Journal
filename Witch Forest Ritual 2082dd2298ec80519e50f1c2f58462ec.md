# Description

I was walking along a dirt path beside a forest at night when I noticed the faint glow of a bonfire in a dirt area behind a red brick wall. As I approached the wall, I saw a witch wearing a purple dress and pointed hat standing on a shipping container to the right likely engaged in a ritual.
