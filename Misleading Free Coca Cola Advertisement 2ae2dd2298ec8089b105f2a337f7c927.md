# Description

I was walking through a shopping mall hallway with Julien, my friend from school, when we noticed a stall with a sign reading "Free Coca-Cola!" Eager for a drink, he approached the female vendor.

> **Julien**: Can we have some free coca cola please?
> 

> **Woman**: That offer requires completing a survey.
> 

> **Julien**: Oh ok.
> 

> **Julien**: I'll just buy two anyway.
> 

> **Julien**: Thanks.
> 

We took the cans and continued walking to the exit on the other side of the mall.
