# Description

I was walking through a shopping mall hallway with Julien, my friend from school, when we noticed a stall with a sign reading "Free Coca-Cola!" Eager for a drink, he approached the female vendor, only to discover that the offer required completing a survey. He was disappointed and bought two cans for both of us anyway and we left.
