# Description

I was standing at the front fly screen door in my unit at night when a grotesque red-orange monster with claws and thick limbs approached the door to look inside. It poked a miniature elongated head from its shoulder through the screen to investigate the lounge room, prompting my brother to slam the door shut. The monster began pacing in long cycles between the door and a distant location beyond the parking lot, emitting faint growls. Occasionally, we peeked outside to check whether the creature would return.

Feeling distressed, my father tried dialling the emergency line, but an automated female voice apologised, explaining the system was overloaded as responders were dispatched to manage a dire flood crisis. Considering it a mistake, I tried calling myself, but my father warned that the keypad numbers on his flip phone were unresponsive, and the same issue persisted with my modern phone, so I gave up. Later upstairs in the doorway of my parents’ master bedroom in pitch darkness, I noticed my mother sitting atop the window air conditioner, with her legs drawn up, cradling our white cat close to her chest. The backdrop of a full moon illuminated the left side of her face as she turned to look at me.

As a torrential rainstorm passed overhead, water trickled through the makeshift gap filler board above the air conditioner. We hurriedly grabbed two thin wooden rectangles, only to discover they were smaller on the sides and swapped them with the others. While entering the bathroom, I began coughing up an almost solid dark grey goo into an open resealable plastic bag positioned in the sink until completely filling it. While disposing it by pouring the chunks into the toilet and flushing with the lid down, liquid sprayed circularly outward onto the floor.
