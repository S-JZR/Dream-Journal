# Description

I was in an RTS videogame where each player was given a hovering spaceship that they could assign one modular utility room on the back (e.g., troop transport, hospital, and radar). The map comprised bases in two rows of four symmetrical islands surrounded by C-shaped mountains. After disembarking onto another territory, some enemy artillery units ambushed from behind on the beach, firing at my recently erected defensive turret. Wanting to protect it, I distributed a row of artillery and tanks that focused fire to neutralize the threat.
