# Description

I was the only one driving down a coastal road with a forest to the right with my windows winded down at night when I encountered different people standing in the middle of the road who were waving their arms and asking for help.

I stopped for a group of clowns but they all simultaneously approached the driver’s window which made me feel nervous and I sped off.

I stopped for a black male teenager but noticed he seemed to be holding a knife that shimmered in the moonlight. However, he turned out to be a friendly average person and demonstrated that it was merely a butterknife.

The scenario repeated with my dad as the driver and me as the passenger. He felt everyone was too suspicious and didn’t stop for anyone or slow down. The clowns jumped out of the way and the black teenager fell on his back as he safely passed under the car.
