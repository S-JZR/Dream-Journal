# Description

I was one of many people, including my brother, seated in a grand cathedral in wooden pews around an elevated central dark grey square stage as the host was about to present a new technology. He started by lying down on a dark grey cushioned bench as the stage was illuminated by red lights that deactivated when he arose.

> **Man 1**: I would like to introduce you to a marvellous chip that will bring new clarity to human interactions and daily living.
**Man 1**: Once inserted into the forehead, it interacts directly with your mind, letting you see, for example, the names of everyone you meet without having to ask them.
> 

I instinctively knew he was only presenting the positive side of the technology to get everyone’s support and not how it could be abused by the government to oppress everyone, track their location, and mind control them. My brother and I felt uncomfortable and started leaving.

> **Brother**: I’ve heard the government has been working on similar technologies for years.
> 

Two men seated in the front of us overheard it.

> **Man 2**: What are you talking about?
**Brother**: The government is building technologies to control us.
**Man 2**: What complete nonsense!
> 

I also thought that we have heard Jim Carrey expose something like this once before and the proof felt definitive.

> **Me**: These are the kinds of people not worth talking to who will disregard everything we say.
**Me**: Let’s leave.
> 

We hurriedly exited onto the footpath and encountered IShowSpeed who also left.

> **Me**: Did that feel like the Antichrist system to you?
**IShowSpeed**: Yeah, something was weird about the red lights and chip.
