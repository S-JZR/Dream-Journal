# Description

Immersed in Team Fortress 2 as the heavy, the distant echoes of conversing dragons enveloped me. Seeking refuge, I boarded a train on an oval track for concealment. The back compartment served as the pilot room featuring machines resembling toaster ovens with pull-down drawers. The top one harnessed the energy of two cylindrical power cells to propel the train forward, whereas the bottom one cooked a plate of lettuce and vegetables already inside.

Pressing both power buttons, the machines hummed to life, setting the train in rapid motion. Navigating around the curved track, I grappled with motion sickness, sensing my organs shift uncomfortably as I strained to peer out of the side compartment window as the scenery blurred until it came to a halt. Faced with the arrival of dragons, I scrambled to locate scattered power cells throughout the entire train, ensuring the continuous operation of the energy converter to evade capture.
