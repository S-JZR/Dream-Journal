# Description

I was standing in the paddock beside my unit complex when I met Tabitha, a member from the Springwood House of Praise Church.

> **Tabitha**: The ghost of a woman has been appearing here recently every day at 3AM and we need to communicate with her.
**Me**: Is the ghost friendly or unfriendly?
**Tabitha**: Unfriendly.
> 

To pass the time we watched The Incredibles in someone's unit.
