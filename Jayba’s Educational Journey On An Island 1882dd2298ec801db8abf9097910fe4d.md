# Description

I was standing on a small grassy island with a connected GUI node path travelling between mini mountains, with Jayba, my cat. I pushed Jayba on my knees along the path for a bit. Eventually, I explored the island and noticed vultures watching from afar.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- The GUI node path resembles a videogame level progression menu.

## Symbols

- Nodes:
    - Educational progress.
- Vultures:
    - Constant dangers in the world.

## Lessons

- Learning is a lifelong journey.

# Post Dream

- It may have predicted the death of Jayba with distant vultures: [details too sensitive to share].
