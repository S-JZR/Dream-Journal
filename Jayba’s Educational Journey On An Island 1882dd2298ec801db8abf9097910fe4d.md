# Description

I was standing on a small grassy island with a path of connected circular GUI nodes travelling between mini mountains, with Jayba, my cat. I pushed Jayba on my knees along the path for a bit. Eventually, I explored the island and noticed vultures watching from afar.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- The GUI path with nodes resembles a video game level progression menu.

## Symbols

- Nodes: educational progress.
- Vultures: the awareness of constant dangers in the world.

## Lessons

- Learning is a lifelong journey.

# Post Dream

- May have predicted the death of Jayba with distant vultures: [details too sensitive to share].
