# Description

I stood on a small grassy island with a circle GUI node path travelling between mini mountains on both sides. On my knees, I pushed my cat, Jayba, across the nodes representing her educational progress. As I ventured off to explore, I noticed vultures watching from afar.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- The GUI path with nodes resembles a video game level progression menu.

## Symbols

- Vultures: the awareness of constant dangers in the world.

## Lessons

- Learning is a lifelong journey.

# Post Dream

- May have predicted the death of Jayba with distant vultures: [details too sensitive to share].
