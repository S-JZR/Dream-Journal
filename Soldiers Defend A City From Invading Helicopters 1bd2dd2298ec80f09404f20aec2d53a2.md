# Description

I was walking along the footpath beside the river in the city with a group of male and female military personnel when a brief subtle earthquake rumbled beneath us. I asked if anyone else heard it, but they said no. However, when it occurred two more times we rushed into a tall rectangular building standing in the river, connected by a small bridge, and ascended to an aircraft hangar cut out of top.

As various hostile helicopters flew past, a woman urged me to board a black aircraft with her that had four hover blades mounted on the sides. She said that due to being a good pilot I should help with managing the control panel that featured a keyboard covering the top. When flying past bluffs on the right, we slowly ascended as a fortress fired a missile that nearly hit us. An enemy helicopter behind us fired heat-seeking missiles, so I pressed the y key that deployed a missile forward. Desperately, I asked the woman how to deploy decoy flares and she said press the x key, so I did.
