# Description

I was standing outside my unit with Angus, an old friend from primary school, as we cleared out my garage. We pulled out a trampoline with various items on top as strong gusts of wind lifted it a few centimetres off the ground so we tried to hold it down. However, the wind grew stronger and the trampoline flew into the sky, the items scattered across roofs and the ground, and we clung tightly to its legs. We strategically titled the trampoline forward to descend and jumped to hold onto the branches of a palm tree outside the units in the paddock that lowered down. Angus and I considered ways to retrieve the misplaced items when I equipped a jetpack and told him to hold onto me as I flew onto the roofs to collect items. Atop the units was a giant rectangular tower with items on top and two vertical columns of glowing green LED blocks separated by a narrow gap. I tried wall jumping between the blocks but it didn’t work so instead I climbed one column. Upon reaching the top, I warned Angus not to look down since it would only terrify him.

I was inside Angus’s house, sorting a bunch of objects into an intermediate group of containers to organize them better and remove junk. I thought that I would have enough time to sort items in my own unit and walked over to work on it. Eventually, Angus’s mother returned and was furious about her house being a mess and someone looking through all their possessions. She appeared at the front door of my unit as a tall giant monster and yelled at my mother, demanding an explanation, assuming it was done maliciously which she knew nothing about. I asked my mother whether paying her $10 for the inconvenience caused would help and she said yes. I approached Angus’s mother at the front door, handed over the money, and apologised for leaving their house in a mess. I explained that I had meant to clean it up but thought I would have enough time to work on other things but it took longer than expected. She calmed down, realizing I had innocent intentions and accepted the apology.
