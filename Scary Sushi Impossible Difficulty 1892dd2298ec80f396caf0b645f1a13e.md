# Description

I was immersed in the Roblox video game “Scary Sushi”, facing a fictional impossible difficulty. The cooking stations demanded triple the ingredients and more detailed steps like mixing dough and baking in the oven. Players passed around individual instruction pamphlets to prepare dishes. The janitor monster, Norman, roaming in the halls connected to pantries was enlarged and duplicated in a looping sequence with narrow gaps between each instance. As ingredients dwindled, players voted on items to purchase for the next round (e.g., dough and sourdough). Additionally, if players took too long the alien antagonist, Hiroshi Kimura, overseeing the kitchen, would sabotage the sushi conveyor belt by sending malicious dishes on levitating robot trays that everyone had to discard before it reached customers.
