# Description

I was in the Scary Sushi videogame on a fictional impossible difficulty with the following changes:

- Dishes required triple the ingredients.
- Dishes had extra steps like mixing dough and baking in the oven.
- Dishes didn’t clearly show instructions and players passed around paper pamphlets.
- Ingredients were limited and players voted on what to purchase for the next round.
- Multiple giant Norman's, the janitor monster, roamed the hallways with small gaps between them.
- If players took too long, Hiroshi Kimura, the villain chef, sabotaged the game by sending levitating robots with malicious dishes in trays on top to the conveyor belt that everyone had to discard before it reached the customers.
