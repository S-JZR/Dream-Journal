# Description

I was walking through an arcade with various people when everyone fell through the floor into a large central hall of a fancy hotel. It had wooden walls with wainscoting, a red carpet with a golden pattern, drawers in a square formation, and a glass dome. Each night the lights deactivated and we had to survive different types of monsters.

I hurriedly slid open the drawers to gather loose scrap, craft a watch, and glance at the time.

> **Me**: Night is almost here!
Me: Hide!
> 

Everyone fled away while I continued scavenging.

During the first night, an anthropomorphic vine monster descended from an open skylight to chase me. I sprinted through the hallway with it close behind and encountered a locked wooden door to the garden that I frantically banged on.

> **Me**: Somebody let me in!
> 

The door immediately swung open and I rushed inside as a man slammed it shut and locked it. The garden featured a concrete floor with various metal shelves, cupboards, and lockers scattered around. Everyone hid in cupboards and a man was with me. The monster dug a person-sized tunnel into the room and I saw it move in front of my cupboard through the door crack then aggressively try forcing it open as we performed timed events to hold it shut. When morning came, the monster ran away and I discovered how it got in.

> **Me**: We should deceive the monster by redirecting the tunnel.
**Others**: Sounds like a plan.
> 

Multiple people helped me dig and reshape the tunnel. Various dark green pot plants on the shelves started emitting green poisonous gas. A male teenager stood beside me and handed over a container.

> **Man**: Pour this on the plants.
> 

I obeyed and the plants instantly shrivelled up.

During the second night, a male ghost appeared and randomly selected a boy and me to be locked inside adjacent cupboards as the doors slammed shut with a green glow inside.

> **Ghost**: Everyone must vote on which of these individuals to spare from death.
**Ghost**: But first, let’s hear both of their cases.
**Me**: (Joking) Skibidi…
**Me**: [Recalling the work I did to help everyone]
**Boy**: ...
> 

The mother assumed that nobody would harm her son for being young but everyone chose to spare me and the boy died.

Half of the room opened to reveal a giant guru statue monster seated with its legs crossed in shallow water. While everyone fought it, I went into a rage, jumped onto its legs, and repeatedly beat it to death as it fell to pieces.
