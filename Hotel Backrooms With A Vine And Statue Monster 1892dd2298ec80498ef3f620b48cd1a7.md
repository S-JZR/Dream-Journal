# Description

I was walking through an arcade with various people when everyone fell through the floor into a fancy hotel themed backrooms level with wooden walls, wainscoting, and a red carpet. We had to survive a monster by completing tasks and hiding away during hunting phases at night. The building featured different rooms including the starting room with drawers arranged in a central square formation and a large glass dome ceiling, a hallway, and a concrete-floored garden area in a side room. Fearing that nightfall was near, I hurriedly slid open drawers, gathering loose scrap to craft a watch, then glanced at the time on it to warn everyone to hide while staying behind to continue scavenging. The lights deactivated as an anthropomorphic vine monster descended from an open skylight. I sprinted to the garden room with it close behind, only to find the wooden door locked so I frantically knocked and cried aloud for someone to let me in. Without hesitation, as the door swung open, I rushed inside, and it was quickly locked behind me. While everyone hid in various cupboards, the monster created a person-sized dirt tunnel into the room behind a set of lockers. It moved in front of the crack in our cupboard door and aggressively tried forcing it open as we performed timed events to hold it in place. When daybreak arrived, I discovered the secret entrance and suggested deceiving the monster by digging another direction then filling the current one to delay it as a few individuals and I got to work. In the garden various dark green plants mixed into other pots sprayed bursts of poisonous gas. Another male teenager instructed me to pour a substance on the plants, making them instantly shrivel up.

A ghostly apparition appeared the next night, asking everyone to choose two players to hold hostage, one of whom was me already standing in a cupboard and a young child as the doors slammed shut with a green glow inside. They asked everyone to vote on who to spare from death. I jokingly said Skibidi to gain crowd favour then proceeded to recall all the work I did to help everyone as the child remained mostly silent with his mother trusting nobody would harm him for being young, but I was chosen to continue.

Half of the room opened to reveal a giant guru statue monster seated in a large shallow body of water with its legs crossed. As everyone fought it, I went into a rage, jumped onto its legs, and repeatedly beat it to death.
