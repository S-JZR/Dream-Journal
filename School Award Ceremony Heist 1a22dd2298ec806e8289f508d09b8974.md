# Description

I was standing on the roof of the hall in my secondary school during an award ceremony at night when Mr Nathan, a staff member, joked about how impenetrable it was to robbery. Seizing the opportunity, I cut a circular hole in the roof with a saw and lowered myself over the crowd with a steel cable.
