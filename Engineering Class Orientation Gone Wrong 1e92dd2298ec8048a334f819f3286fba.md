# Description

I was one of many university students waiting in a line outside my primary school to attend an engineering orientation class. I personally wanted to evaluate how difficult the career path was and the extent of my knowledge gap. A female teacher approached the front of the line, warning us that a few students had listed year 7-level mathematics as their only experience on their applications. She emphasized that this won’t cut it, as we needed to be willing to put in the hard work to develop competence in advanced mathematics, or we wouldn’t make it in the real world.

Everyone moved through the year 7 block, where the teacher asked a bunch of children standing nearby what the school's learning motto was and they replied "honour is not freely given but earned by merit". While entering my old year 7 classroom, we were told to sit on the floor in front of all the desks as she asked everyone to raise their hands based on the reason they were interested in engineering and move to sit at a desk with an exam paper on it. Most students had a specific specialization in mind, but I was one of the remaining few who didn't have a clear reason and resorted to "other".

As I sat in the front row with the teacher's desk in front, she called my name aloud to ask me a question but I instinctively said "here" as everyone chuckled. She humorously pointed out that she wasn’t my care teacher from prior schooling and that things were done differently at university.

    - I only learnt maths A in secondary school and worry that I’ve limited my future success.
    - I’m still uncertain of where I want to end up in my career and haven't explored it too deeply.
    - The “Role Call” is too embarrassing to share.

## Symbols
