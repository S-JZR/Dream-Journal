# Description

I was lying on the bunk bed upstairs in my room in my unit, peeking through the blinds, when I noticed a distant fireball descending from the sky and instinctively knew it was a nuclear missile. I turned around, yelling at my family dispersed throughout the house to get inside the fridge, thinking that the lead lining would shield the imminent blast like in Indiana Jones. Suddenly, a colossal explosion erupted, unleashing a blinding white light that engulfed everything. Amid desperate screams, only silence escaped from my mouth. After a brief pause, my voice returned, rapidly increasing in volume until it became unbearable.
