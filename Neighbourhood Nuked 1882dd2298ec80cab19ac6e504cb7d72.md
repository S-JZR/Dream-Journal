# Description

Glimpsing through the blinds from the upstairs room in my unit complex, I observed an illuminated fireball descending from the sky in the distance. Sensing that it was a nuclear warhead, I urgently turned around, yelling at my family dispersed throughout the house to get inside the fridge, thinking that the lead lining would shield the imminent blast like in Indiana Jones. Suddenly, a colossal explosion erupted, unleashing a blinding white light that engulfed everything. Amid desperate screams, only silence escaped from my mouth. After a brief pause, my voice returned, rapidly increasing in volume until it became unbearable.
