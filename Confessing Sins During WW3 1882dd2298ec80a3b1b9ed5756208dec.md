# Description

As the low hum of a plane circled the sky nearby, my family exited our unit and walked into the car park to investigate. Suddenly, a World War Two-era plane swooped down to unleash a barrage of machine gun fire that illuminated a strip of ground with sparks.

We hurried inside and gathered upstairs in the master bedroom, sitting in a circle on the bed. An earthquake started and gradually increased in intensity. My parents took the initiative to confess their sins and asked whether we would do the same. We did, and everything faded to white.
