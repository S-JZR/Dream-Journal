# Description

I was walking in the Alps with two strangers when we were kidnapped by a businessman to be used as test subjects for a cleaning product demonstration. We were bound in rope, covered in dirt, and placed in the centre of an assembly of yetis inside an illuminated cave. He demonstrated a cleaning product resembling a giant ceiling fan with brushes for blades. However, the uncultured yetis failed to grasp its purpose and lacked interest.
