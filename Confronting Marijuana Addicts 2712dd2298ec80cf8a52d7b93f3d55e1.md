# Description

I was standing in a building with two men who lacked higher ambitions and merely discussed what type of marijuana they would smoke later. They also had a young sister. I told them they could achieve so much more if they weren't obsessed with chasing cheap thrills and focused on intellectual and skill development. They were annoyed at being lectured about what to do with their lives and stood in front of me. Their sister made a strange false comparison and asked me what a term meant. I feared getting it wrong and seeming like a fraud so I gave a simple answer.

I tried reasoning with them, saying they don't understand what they are capable of because they have never worked to reach a high level and gained an overview perspective on the foolish behaviours of the general public. People are easily ensnared by instant gratification and the immediate content promoted by society that they tolerate chasing vanity and reduce themselves to idiots. However, they still refused to concede.

I stood on a concrete balcony watching them sit in a shallow river below and decided to exploit their desires by tossing marijuana and other items into the current as they gathered them in a rectangular plastic container when it flowed past. While holding a detonator, I said that I have rigged everything with explosives and they will die if they don't quit doing drugs. One man smiled in disbelief and pushed his container away so I couldn't do anything.
