# Description

I was one of many survivors in a hardcore wave-based zombie survival videogame. Everyone could choose to level up different skillsets and many structures could be upgraded by hitting them multiple times with wrenches.

In wave one everyone was in a remote field beside a large building with an exterior c-shaped skywalk on stilts that looped back into it and had a chain-linked fenced and metal awning on top. Initially everyone explored the building to look for supplies but I left early to prepare for the next wave.

In wave two basic zombies were introduced and we lost control of the large building and surrounding area as they broke through various barricaded windows and ran through the building and skywalk. I encountered 7 survivors in the field preparing a level 1 circle of sandbags around a mounted machine gun. I choose the engineering skillset and provided 2 upgrade points per hit instead of 1. As zombies kept getting too close to our defences, I switched between helping shoot them and continuing to upgrade the sandbags. The level 2 sandbags had an extra top layer and support from wooden planks.

In wave three a dense purple fog and a few special zombies were introduced. Seeing that no zombies were around, I briefly roamed to look for materials but returned to find everyone missing and continued to upgrade the defences. The level 3 sandbags turned into a small concrete bunker with no windows, no hatch, and was camouflaged as a purple zombie with exterior masks to reduce attack rates. After finishing a basic metal hatch, a purple hairy zombie rapidly approached from the fog and effortlessly climbed the bunker to claw at the hatch which subtracted its upgrade points. I continued repairing the hatch to prevent the zombie from getting inside because I didn’t know what else to do.
