# Description

I was one of many mafia members wearing black jackets who called themselves "the bad police". While driving on the highway, we encountered an unaffiliated mafia group in a black car pulled over mugging people in a red car. After exchanging gunfire, they sped off with us in close pursuit, until entering a city where we lost track of them as they turned through a series of streets. When guessing their routes, we ended up near a police station on the opposite side of the road with a few officers wandering nearby as we got out to look around. One of our members repeatedly flicked a folding knife open and shut as a female cop scolded him and suggested to get it magnetised so it wouldn’t be so manoeuvrable.
