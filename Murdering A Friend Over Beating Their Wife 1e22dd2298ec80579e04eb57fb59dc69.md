# Description

I was in a remote neighbourhood with a low police presence when a fictional black man I had known for years came to dine with my family and would use a signature plate we kept on the shelf. Afterwards, we travelled together onto a lake in a canoe where he started jokingly boasting about constantly beating his wife which sent me into a rage as I overturned the boat and held him underwater to drown. Initially I felt euphoric but when returning to shore, deep remorse set in as I realized what I had done. Images of our relationship and the event flashed through my mind throughout the day, haunting me with guilt. I rushed back to the house to hide the evidence and noticed the tableware was still unwashed with various items already beside and inside the sink amidst bubbles. I began to slide his plate and cutlery behind a bookshelf, but fearing the leftover sauce would rot and attract insects, I scrubbed them off in the sink first and placed them behind again as water still dripped off. Five police officers in dark blue uniforms approached the front porch to investigate reports of his disappearance so I invited them inside but they found nothing. Feeling guilty, I considered turning myself in but I didn't want to go to jail, especially after Googling how long the sentence would be on my phone. However, I proceeded to enter the police station, only to discover nobody was there. I walked into the holding cell by myself and shut the door but quickly changed my mind to leave.

Various diverse men gathered outside my house and a host asked whether I wanted to be a candidate for dating. I agreed and stood in a line with five other men as a woman stood in front. The host asked everyone to state whether they were interested in dating her. The others said "yes" or "no," but I said, "I don't know.” The event suddenly expanded with 50 men in parallel lines beside the woman in the centre. As I stood in the front-left spot, the host asked everyone to explain why they considered themselves a worthwhile candidate. I didn't find myself appealing and didn't want to burden them with my murder case, so I walked away before it was my turn to speak.

I walked to a 7-Eleven and noticed they were selling crushed marijuana in small plastic bags, so I decided to try it for the first time. While the male cashier was busy talking to another customer to their left, I laid a line of it on the counter. He looked over, yelled at me to stop, rolled it into a joint himself, and placed it in a plastic bag where it spontaneously combusted. I asked how he set it alight without a lighter, and he said, "All you have to do is shake the bag.” After walking around the store, I ate one end of the joint but nothing occurred so I puffed the rest as my vision zoomed in and I felt energetic. As the cashier walked past to restock the shelves, I told him that I didn't really enjoy it because it tasted bad, made me feel weird, and made it difficult to think.

After walking further down the street, I encountered Jesus at an indoor banquet featuring a long table with 50 chairs on both sides. Most people were already seated but a few were roaming around and talking with him. I moved to silently stand beside him and considered talking about my situation but deemed it a bad idea with everyone around so I planned to wait until the event ended. He turned around to look at me and invited me to take a seat so I sat in the back-right spot.
