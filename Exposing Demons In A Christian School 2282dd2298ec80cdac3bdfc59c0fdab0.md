# Description

I was standing in the classroom of a Christian school with other students and a female teacher:

- Left:
    - Door to a balcony.
- Centre:
    - Multiple foldout tables featuring green silk cloths, hotdogs on plates, and tomato sauce and mustard plastic containers.
    - Triangular ceiling:
        - Front: wooden ladder leading to a small loft.
        - Back: vertical rectangular window.
- Right:
    - Pigeon holes for school bags.
    - Door to a hallway.

The teacher hosted a hotdog eating contest with everyone seated at tables in alphabetical groups. The table I was supposed to sit as was full since Sarajah had taken the last spot so I tried other tables. However, other seats were covered in a few hotdogs and splattered with sauces. One seat was completely covered in mustard and I tried scraping it off with a tissue but it disintegrated from being soaked. After standing for a while to avoid getting dirty, the teacher grew frustrated.

> **Teacher**: You’re all deliberately impeding the lesson by making a mess and not sitting down.
**Me**: That’s an unjust hasty generalisation.
**Me**: I didn’t see anyone cause the mess or participate in it.
> 

She had a mental breakdown and burst into tears so I took charge.

> **Me**: Go wash your face.
**Me**: We’ll clean the chairs.
**Me**: Are there any wipes we can use?
> 

She didn't respond and left the room so everyone did their best to clean the seats with tissues but a few students were still disgusted by the leftover traces that were difficult to remove. She never returned and a female substitute entered through the right door to continue the class and I was worried the original teacher quit or was fired. The substitute didn't know the lesson’s previous topic or progress.

> **Substitute**: Today we’ll be talking about managing finances.
> 

I felt none of the teachers addressed core Christian doctrines like sin or the gospel and instead focused on entertainment, surface-level topics, and non-biblical practical advice.

> **Me**: You’re doing an awful job!
**Me**: I can lead the class if you want.
**Substitute**: Alright come on up.
**Me**: There was once an individual who tried to keep up appearances to please God and others but hid their sins.
> 

Loud banging in the attic distracted everyone as a few students, including me, climbed up to find an invisible force banging the floorboards.

> **Me**: In the name of Jesus I command you foul spirit to leave!
> 

The noise stopped and after descending everything seemed fine but the attic temporarily glowed green and white smoke cascaded down. I instinctively knew an invisible demon tried to resist leaving but failed. Time ran out and everyone gathered their bags to leave as a young kid eagerly approached.

> **Kid**: How did you do that? Do you have superpowers?
**Me**: It’s not me who has the power to cast out demons but Jesus who has given us the authority to do it in his name.
**Me**: I'm merely following his command and imitating him.
**Me**: You can read about it in the Bible which is God's word shared with us.
> 

I was afraid he might read the Old Testament and stop after being intimidated by the graphic sins and God’s judgements.

> **Me**: God is a holy and just judge who confronts all sins and is not watered down to please us.
**Me**: You won’t understand all the mature content in the Old Testament until you’re older.
> 

I approached a woman seated at the front reception desk.

> **Me**: Where has my teacher gone?
**Woman**: I don’t know.
> 

I was frustrated with the school and walked to the back of the library containing books and student records with a flamethrower. I warned every group of students I passed.

> **Me**: Whoever doesn’t want to die, leave now!
> 

Everyone fled. I released quick burst of fire to ignite everything as flames spread throughout the library.

I returned to the same classroom for another lesson with a different female teacher who was finally discussing biblical topics. However, I was distracted by a whispering disembodied voice.

> **Wolf**: Does God really exist?
**Wolf**: This is all so silly.
> 

I turned around to look through the back ceiling window and saw a white wolf standing on two legs in front of a nearby tree, staring in. I pointed it out to everyone.

> **Me**: Can anyone else see that or am I hallucinating?
**Everyone**: We don’t see anything you’re crazy.
