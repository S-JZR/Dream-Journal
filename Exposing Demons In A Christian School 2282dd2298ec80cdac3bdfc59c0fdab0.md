# Description

I was with multiple people and a female teacher in a classroom at a Christian school that featured:

- Left:
    - Door to a balcony.
- Centre:
    - Multiple foldout tables with green silk cloths, plates with hot dogs, and plastic containers of tomato sauce and mustard.
    - Triangular ceiling:
        - Wooden ladder and open attic at the front.
        - Vertical window at the back.
- Right:
    - Pigeon holes for school bags.
    - Door to the hallway.

The teacher hosted a hotdog competition and everyone was seated in alphabetical groups at different tables. The table I was supposed to sit as was full since Sarajah had taken the last spot so I tried other tables. However, other seats were covered in a few hotdogs and splattered with sauces. One seat was completely covered in mustard sauce and I tried scraping it off with a tissue but it disintegrated from being soaked. After standing for a while to avoid getting dirty, the teacher grew frustrated and accused everyone of deliberately impeding the lesson by making the mess and not complacently sitting down. It might have been true, but I never saw anyone causing it nor participated in it, so I said she was making an unjust hasty generalisation. She had a mental breakdown and burst into tears. Taking charge, I instructed her to wash her face outside and explained that the students would clean the chairs. Everyone agreed. I asked if any wipes were available but she didn't respond and left the room so we just used tissues. Everyone did there best to clean the seats but a few students were still disgusted by the leftover traces that were difficult to remove.

She never returned and a female substitute entered through the right door to continue the class and I was worried the original teacher quit or was fired. The substitute didn't know the lesson’s previous topic or progress and proceeded to discuss managing finances. I felt none of the teachers addressed core Christian doctrines like sin or the gospel and instead focused on entertainment, surface-level topics, and non-biblical practical advice. I openly accused her of doing an awful job and offered to lead the class which she accepted. I discussed an individual who tried keeping up appearances to please God and others but was hiding sin. Loud banging in the attic distracted everyone as a few students, including me, climbed up to investigate but only to find a supernatural force banging the floorboards. I decided to try casting out a demon for the first time in the name of Jesus and the noise stopped. After descending, everything seemed fine but the attic temporarily glowed green and white smoke cascaded down. I instinctively knew an invisible demon tried to resist leaving but failed. Time ran out and everyone gathered their bags to leave as a young kid eagerly approached me, asking how I did it, thinking I had some superpower. However, I told him it was Jesus who has the power to cast out demons, he has given us the authority, and I'm merely following his command and imitating him. I said he can read about this in the bible which is God's word shared with us. Concerned that he might stop reading after struggling with the true nature of God’s justice in the Old Testament and not a watered down version designed to please everyone, I warned him that God is a holy just judge who confronts all sins and he wouldn't understand all the mature content until he was older.

I went to the reception desk and asked the female receptionist where the original teacher had gone but she didn’t know. Frustrated with the entire Bible school, I cocked a flamethrower and proceeded to the back of the library, which held books and student records. I warned every group of students I passed, shouting, “Whoever doesn’t want to die, leave now!” and they all fled. I feared that someone might try to stop me by tackling me but nothing occurred. I released quick burst of fire to ignite everything as flames spread throughout the entire room.

I returned to the same classroom for another lesson with a different female teacher who was finally discussing biblical topics. However, I was distracted by a disembodied voice whispering doubts and vile things. When I turned around and looked up through the back ceiling window, I saw a white wolf idly standing on two legs in front of a nearby tree, starring in. I loudly pointed it out and asked if anyone else saw it or if I was hallucinating but no one seemed to notice and they thought I was crazy.
