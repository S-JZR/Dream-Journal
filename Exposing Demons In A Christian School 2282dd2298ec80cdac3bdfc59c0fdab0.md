# Description

I was standing in the classroom of a Christian school with other students and a female teacher:

- left:
    - door to a balcony
- centre:
    - multiple foldout tables featuring green silk cloths, hotdogs on plates, and tomato sauce and mustard plastic containers
    - triangular ceiling:
        - front wooden ladder leading to a small loft
        - back vertical rectangular window
- right:
    - pigeon holes for school bags
    - door to a hallway.

The teacher hosted a hotdog eating contest with everyone seated at tables in alphabetical groups. The table I was supposed to sit as was full since Sarajah had taken the last spot so I tried other tables. However, other seats were covered in a few hotdogs and splattered with sauces. One seat was completely covered in mustard and I tried scraping it off with a tissue but it disintegrated from being soaked. After standing for a while to avoid getting dirty, the teacher grew frustrated.

> **Teacher**: You’re all deliberately impeding the lesson by making a mess and not sitting down.
> 

> **Me**: That’s an unjust hasty generalisation.
> 

> **Me**: I didn’t see anyone cause the mess or participate in it.
> 

She had a mental breakdown and burst into tears so I took charge.

> **Me**: Go wash your face.
> 

> **Me**: We’ll clean the chairs.
> 

> **Me**: Are there any wipes we can use?
> 

She didn't respond and left the room so everyone did their best to clean the seats with tissues but a few students were still disgusted by the leftover traces that were difficult to remove. She never returned and a female substitute entered through the right door to continue the class and I was worried the original teacher quit or was fired. The substitute didn't know the lesson’s previous topic or progress.

> **Substitute**: Today we’ll be talking about managing finances.
> 

I felt none of the teachers addressed core Christian doctrines like sin or the gospel and instead focused on entertainment, surface-level topics, and non-biblical practical advice.

> **Me**: You’re doing an awful job!
> 

> **Me**: I can lead the class if you want.
> 

> **Substitute**: Alright come on up.
> 

> **Me**: There was once an individual who tried to keep up appearances to please God and others but hid their sins.
> 

Loud banging in the attic distracted everyone as a few students, including me, climbed up to find an invisible force banging the floorboards.

> **Me**: In the name of Jesus I command you foul spirit to leave!
> 

The noise stopped and after descending everything seemed fine but the attic temporarily glowed green and white smoke cascaded down. I instinctively knew an invisible demon tried to resist leaving but failed. Time ran out and everyone gathered their bags to leave as a young kid eagerly approached.

> **Boy**: How did you do that?
> 

> **Boy**: Do you have superpowers?
> 

> **Me**: It’s not me who has the power to cast out demons but Jesus who has given us the authority to do it in his name.
> 

> **Me**: I'm merely following his command and imitating him.
> 

> **Me**: You can read about it in the Bible which is God's word shared with us.
> 

I was afraid he might read the Old Testament and stop after being intimidated by the graphic sins and God’s judgements.

> **Me**: God is a holy and just judge who confronts all sins and is not watered down to please us.
> 

> **Me**: You won’t understand all the mature content in the Old Testament until you’re older.
> 

I approached a woman seated at the front reception desk.

> **Me**: Where has my teacher gone?
> 

> **Woman**: I don’t know.
> 

I was frustrated with the school and walked to the back of the library containing books and student records with a flamethrower. I warned every group of students I passed.

> **Me**: Whoever doesn’t want to die, leave now!
> 

Everyone fled. I released quick burst of fire to ignite everything as flames spread throughout the library.

I returned to the same classroom for another lesson with a different female teacher who was finally discussing biblical topics. However, I was distracted by a whispering disembodied voice.

> **Wolf**: Does God really exist?
> 

> **Wolf**: This is all so silly.
> 

I turned around to look through the back ceiling window and saw a white wolf standing on two legs in front of a nearby tree, staring in. I pointed it out to everyone.

> **Me**: Can anyone else see that or am I hallucinating?
> 

> **Everyone**: We don’t see anything you’re crazy.
> 

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - My brother, another church member, and I once attended a youth group event but my brother and I were appalled by its performative nature with a hot dog eating contest on fold-out tables, a few worship songs, and casual calls to give your life to Christ.
    - During religious education in primary school, Carley randomly flipped through the bible and told others about the stories of rape she was repulsed by and implied the book was evil and should be avoided.
- Christianity:
    - References casting out demons.
    - References Mark 16:17, Luke 13:3, Hebrews 12:29, and Acts 20:29-31.
- Online Videos:
    - References that during exorcisms demons are often hesitant to leave people.
    - References Ray Comfort saying God is loving but also a holy judge who punishes sin and warns against turning him into a watered-down idol to please ourselves: [https://youtu.be/iE-P7KGZi_o?si=25qWN0HWSj_llFzs&t=548](https://youtu.be/iE-P7KGZi_o?si=25qWN0HWSj_llFzs&t=548).
