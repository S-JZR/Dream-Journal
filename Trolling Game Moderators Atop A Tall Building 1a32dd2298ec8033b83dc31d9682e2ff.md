# Description

While immersed in a video game, I stood outside the construction site of a 20-storey building, its concrete frame adorned with elongated rectangular window gaps on all sides for each level. Additionally, beside one corner freely stood a taller singular wall of concrete balconies. Overhearing moderators conversing on the roof, I decided to troll them by firing shotgun slugs from afar to slay them. Enraged, they sent various robots resembling R6 Roblox character models to hunt me. Retreating to the ground floor, I hopped up multiple stacked slanted V-shaped concrete slabs to reach the top. An arrogant female moderator still present avenged her team by spamming multitudes of robots now capable of flying.

I went to the ground floor, but they were already pathfinding up the slanted exterior, so I entered indoors until encountering another player who offer to assist fighting. After asking whether he wanted a machine gun or shotgun, he requested the latter. While purchasing a spare, I levelled up all my stats and bought new gear like a jetpack. However, after firing a few shots, he didn't know how to reload. After pressing “R” failed, I tried demonstrating in VR with a hovering ammo UI, but accidentally triggered something, causing all attachments to fall. As metallic footsteps approached, I hurriedly picked up a few things, then fled upstairs alone for personal safety. Seeing robots atop the roof, I flew sideways, concealing myself in a balcony by laying down to evade their tracking as spectating moderators were audibly annoyed by my strategies.

The entities continuously spawning caused severe server lag. Tired of playing, I sought to find her to surrender. Upon reaching the woman, I asked her to end the game by blowing me up, so she placed explosive at my feet then detonated them. After quitting the videogame I was 15 minutes late for class, I struggled to recall what it was, initially thinking it was swimming. However, remembering I switched it to marathon running due to hating it, I fled to the school oval.
