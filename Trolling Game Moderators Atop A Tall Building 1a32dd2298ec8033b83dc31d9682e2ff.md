# Description

I was in a sandbox videogame standing in a construction zone:

- centre:
    - 20-storey concrete building skeleton with elongated rectangular window gaps on each level
- bottom-right:
    - free standing giant concrete wall of balconies.

I ascended to the roof where I overheard moderators conversing and downed them with shotgun slugs from a distance to troll them. Enraged, they sent various robots resembling R6 Roblox character models to hunt me. Retreating to the ground floor, I hopped up multiple stacked slanted V-shaped concrete slabs to reach the top. An arrogant female moderator still present avenged her team by spamming multitudes of robots now capable of flying.

I went to the ground floor, but they were already pathfinding up the slanted exterior, so I entered indoors until encountering another player who offer to assist fighting. After asking whether he wanted a machine gun or shotgun, he requested the latter. While purchasing a spare, I levelled up all my stats and bought new gear like a jetpack. However, after firing a few shots, he didn't know how to reload. After pressing “R” failed, I tried demonstrating in VR with a hovering ammo UI, but accidentally triggered something, causing all attachments to fall. As metallic footsteps approached, I hurriedly picked up a few things, then fled upstairs alone for personal safety. Seeing robots atop the roof, I flew sideways, concealing myself in a balcony by laying down to evade their tracking as spectating moderators were audibly annoyed by my strategies.

The entities continuously spawning caused severe server lag. Tired of playing, I sought to find her to surrender. Upon reaching the woman, I asked her to end the game by blowing me up, so she placed explosive at my feet then detonated them. After quitting the videogame I was 15 minutes late for class, I struggled to recall what it was, initially thinking it was swimming. However, remembering I switched it to marathon running due to hating it, I fled to the school oval.
