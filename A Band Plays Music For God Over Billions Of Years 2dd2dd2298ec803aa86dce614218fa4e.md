# Description

I was in heaven spectating a band playing music for God who was seated on his throne. White sans-serif text overlaid a background of space with a few stars stating “2,132,654,256 years passed” (a male narrator also said it). After all that time, the band was still playing music for God.

    - Possibly references pastor Jim W, an old pastor, who said in a sermon that in heaven we will be immortal and in a gazillion years the pianist will probably still be playing.
