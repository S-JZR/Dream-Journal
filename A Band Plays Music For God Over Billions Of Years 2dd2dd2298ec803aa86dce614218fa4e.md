# Description

I was in heaven spectating a band playing music through rotating shifts for God who was seated on his throne.

The next shot was of space with a few stars overlaid with white sans-serif text stating “2,132,654,256 years passed”.

> **Male Narrator**: 2,132,654,256 years passed.
> 

The shot returned to the band and they were still playing music.
