# Description

I was standing at the front door of my unit when I saw a Japanese eating gameshow setup outside on the grass beside the pathway. Four male and one female contestants sat behind a long table covered with a white clothe, different plated meals on top, and a large rectangular banner with a pattern and logotype behind them.

I asked a nearby female staff member if the contestants spoke English but she said no. I told her to ask if they wanted to try some broth that looked like water on their food to see if it tasted better and they agreed. While picking up a large translucent rectangular plastic container from a side table, I approached each individual, scooped some out with a plastic cup, took a tiny sip to try it myself, dipped it back in to refill it, and poured it on their food. The first man on the left looked disturbed that I contaminated the liquid but remained silent.
