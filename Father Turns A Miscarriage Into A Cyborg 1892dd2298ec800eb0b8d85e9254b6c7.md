# Description

A father descended into madness following the tragic miscarriage of his son. Refusing to accept death, he performed graphic surgeries, embedding metallic components and rods beneath the skin by lifting flaps of flesh, transforming his son into a cyborg. Various blueprints showed the required wiring and sensory devices for the transformation. Standing on the concrete outside a shed beside someone's house, he proudly introduced the cyborg baby as his latest invention to his friends who watched intently as it crawled around in the centre of the area. A conveyor system, shaped like a quarter oval with a straight path leading back to the centre, temporarily detached half of its body containing the power source, rendering it lifeless until the parts slid around to reconnect. His goal was to enhance both of their bodies over time by gradually introducing new components to facilitate different stages of life to ultimately achieve immortality together.

Thugs were sent to attack me, presumably for attempting to expose the unethical operation to authorities and risk the state terminating the son. I sought refuge at a two-story log police station nestled deep within a forest to report the incident to a female receptionist. However, a male agent embedded within the police force knocked her out from behind while other thugs stormed in from adjoining rooms. I swiftly barricaded a vacant room with furniture as they tried to breach the door. Realizing my only escape was jumping from a high window, I tore off a long wooden board nearby to cushion my fall. Unfortunately, it snapped upon impact with the remaining energy severely injuring one of my legs as I limped away. Desperate to evade detection, I slid around the building with my back against the wall, hiding in blind spots beneath protruding windowsills while the thugs searched above and below for any sign of me. I failed it a few times, repeating it like a video game.

The thugs were distracted by an illuminated festival on a distant hill, providing me the opportunity to escape to another location. Stumbling upon a remote area, I encountered the teenage son and his father experimenting with a cyborg augmentation machine equipped with a surgical pod. They took turns sitting inside to undergo a series of surgeries, gradually transforming into androids with their perceptions altered by a HUD overlaying paragraphs of data about their surroundings. Unwilling to lose his humanity, the son retaliated against his father, who was deeply offended and sought to force him to continue. Using jet boots, the son levitated into the sky and dove headfirst at his father, decapitating them both as they lay motionless with overlaid text stating this is the neutral ending.
