# Description

I was seated at my computer in my unit on a video chat on Omegle with someone who had a black screen and was pretending to be a girl by sending flirty and cute messages that I briefly replied to. However, when my mother approached from behind, a white obese bearded fat man only wearing pants appeared on screen, facing forward, and yelled “Now here is my fat ass!”, which played loudly through the speakers, causing her to wonder what was going on. In a panic, I hurriedly dragged the browser window off the screen and repeatedly tried to click it closed.
