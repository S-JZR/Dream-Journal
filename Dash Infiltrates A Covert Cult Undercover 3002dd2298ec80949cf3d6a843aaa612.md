# Description

Dash from The Incredible was sent undercover to investigate a food autonomation company called Auto Co with suspicious activity at a summer camp event. He entered a large function hall where Auto Co and Doughnut King had two rectangular temporary structures on opposite sides of the room serving food. The Auto Co structure was grey and smooth with a front door on the left, a glass display with individual compartments on the right, and a compact fully autonomous kitchen inside with robot arms. The founders of Auto Co, an old woman and man with grey hair, were hosting their stall and were secretly operating a cult that conditioned people by framing everything as a fun game.

Everyone was separated to the two companies based on what letter their name started with and Dash was sent to Auto Co and put on a grey shirt. When the male founder opened the door to move inside a male teenager tried peeking in out of curiosity.

> **Male Founder**: Excuse me this is a restricted area and you’re not allowed in here.
**Man**: Are you the only ones working back here?
**Male Founder**: Yes the entire process is fully automated with precise machines.
> 

Dash lined up with everyone to assemble their own hotdogs as ingredients were automatically dispensed in the glass compartments including cooked sausages, mustard in plastic packets, and buns.

Over the next few days the founders slowly started conditioning everyone to change their behaviours like adopting an acceptable at-ease stance which nobody questioned because it sounded logical and everyone else was doing it.

> **Female Founder**: Put your arms by your sides in an L-shape to be hygienic so you avoid touching sweat under your armpits.
> 

A few individuals who didn’t perform well or caused a nuisance were sent to a stainless steel bathroom in a concrete back area to the left which they were expected to enter themselves and be killed without anyone knowing. A mysterious female midget wearing a uniform with their face covered started appearing at a distance in the side area with the bathroom and tried helping Dash by holding up their fingers to show the number of days left until he was going to be killed which decreased from five to one over time. Dash didn’t know what to think of it until the last day when she pointed at him and did a cut-throat gesture and he started realizing what was happening.

> **Female Founder**: Well it’s that time again and the next individual who is eliminated is Dash.
> 

Dash walked into the side area and saw that the side bathroom was open with a light but refused to enter. The founders were aware of his disobedience and sent everyone to catch him.

> **Female Founder**: It seems Dash is being a bad sport who is refusing to leave.
**Female Founder**: How about we have a special event where the first person to catch him receives a reward.
> 

Dash used his super speed to kick open grills along an air vent shaft until entering another backroom with barrels full of oil. The door handles in the room started turning so he emptied the barrels on the floor and ignited them with friction as the doors opened and everyone was hesitant to enter inside.

> **Female Founder**: No!
**Female Founder**: What are you doing?
> 

Other barrels also exploded and Dash used them to launch into the ceiling which was now various layers of lightweight see-through fabric and tore holes through them which made them loose. Dash struggled to climb up because he couldn’t get solid footing and an abnormally large muscular male henchman wearing black started rapidly climbing up towards him.
