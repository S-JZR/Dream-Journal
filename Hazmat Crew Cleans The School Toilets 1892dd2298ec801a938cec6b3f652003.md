# Description

At my secondary school outside the English block toilets, I was extremely disgusted by the grimy walls and clogged toilets. Resorting to alternatives beside the tuckshop in the school centre, they were no better with a dark grey taint. Suddenly, a clean-up crew wearing blue hazmat suits enclosed the perimeter in yellow caution tape and began power washing, covering the ground in a thick layer of bubbles. After completion, all the students were astonished to see shiny white tiles everywhere, realizing years of neglect allowed the filth to accumulate.
