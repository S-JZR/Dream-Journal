# Description

I was standing outside the English block toilets at my secondary school and felt disgusted by the grimy walls and clogged toilets. Resorting to alternatives beside the tuckshop in the school centre, they were no better with a dark grey taint. Suddenly, a clean-up crew wearing blue hazmat suits enclosed the perimeter in yellow caution tape and began power washing, covering the ground in a thick layer of bubbles. After completion, all the students were astonished to see shiny white tiles everywhere, realizing years of neglect allowed the filth to accumulate.
