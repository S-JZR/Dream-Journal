# Description

I was sleeping in my unit when my mum woke me up at 10:00 am for sleeping in and being late for the end-of-year sports day at my secondary school. She asked what time I needed to be dropped off, so I pulled out a multi-coloured schedule indicating that various student groups were asked to arrive at different times. I suddenly realized that the Year 12 slot was the only one running throughout the entire day, meaning I should have arrived earlier.

Upon entering the school, I stood by the large tree on the oval and started lightly tugging my chin beard as large clumps tore off unexpectedly, revealing patches of skin.

To conclude the day, everyone was invited into the hall for the final activity divided into four colour-coded teams standing in an x-shape around a slowly rotating circular platform where cups filled with soda were arranged the same way. The objective was each team member was assigned money and had to accumulate the most by hitting three balls with a tennis racket into opponents' cups to take their cash. During my turn, two shots missed, but the last one barely landed in the furthest cup, so I took a few notes.
