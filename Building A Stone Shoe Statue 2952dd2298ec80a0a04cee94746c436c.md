# Description

I was standing on the lawn in my university with five students when Mrs Sheil, a staff member, privately spoke to us. She remarked how World War 3 was imminent and asked us to dismantle old meaningless stone cube statues around the campus which she felt were outdated with the university’s image and transform them into a new stone shoe statue.

As I considered ideas for a sci-fi shoe design, she stood behind a podium to deliver a public speech to a crowd about how great the university was and how students consistently achieve high academic results. I felt annoyed because we were wasting time on trivial aesthetic projects to promote the university instead of working on things to ensure our survival while she seemed more concerned with doing business as usual by selling the brand and degrees to keep society distracted.
