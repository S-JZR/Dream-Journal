# Description

A gameover screen in Metal Arms Glitch In The System showed a 2D animation of Glitch in bad condition with loose body parts walking on a sidewalk over a spherical plane toward the horizon at dawn with a muted dark green sky. The animation was choppy like a demo animatic with Glitch rapidly alternating between frames of stepping with his left and right foot.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I used to play Metal Arms Glitch In The System a lot as a child.
- The walking animation could have been influenced by a demo animatic or Damo and Darren 1 (NSFW) which was featured on YouTube’s home page: [https://youtu.be/vmL72sgVdAQ?si=4OpKqpNbqSqilyke&t=143](https://youtu.be/vmL72sgVdAQ?si=4OpKqpNbqSqilyke&t=143).
