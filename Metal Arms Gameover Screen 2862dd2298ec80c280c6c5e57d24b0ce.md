# Description

A gameover screen in Metal Arms Glitch In The System showed a 2D animation of Glitch in bad condition with loose body parts walking on a sidewalk over a spherical plane toward the horizon at dawn with a muted dark green sky. The animation was choppy like a demo animatic with Glitch rapidly alternating between frames of stepping with his left and right foot.
