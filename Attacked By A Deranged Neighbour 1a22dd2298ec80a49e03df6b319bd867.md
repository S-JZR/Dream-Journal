# Description

Later, my left-hand neighbour became deranged and frantically pounded on my fly screen door. As I cautiously creaked open the wooden door to peek outside, he thrust a car aerial through the mesh, striking my stomach with a sinister snicker. Irritated, I yanked it from him, only to discover he also had a four-socket power board connected to an extension cord that led to his unit, attempting to electrocute me. Nevertheless, I reached through the fly screen, pulled the board towards me, and threatened to shine a laser at him if I had one. He giggled and casually returned to his unit.
