# Description

I was one of many apprentice chefs in a cooking class when the female instructor gave everyone aprons to wear and led us to to the top of a wide ski slope in a tunnel. A series of elevated wooden square boxes on black metal frames lined the entire right side with each containing a random grid arrangement of doughnuts and small round potted cacti. We were tasked with sliding down to the bottom and collecting as many doughnuts as possible without touching or collecting any of the cacti. During my first attempt, I was hesitant about getting injured as the boxes rapidly moved past and apathetically missed everything. She scolded me for lacking enthusiasm for the craft, told me to remove my apron, and leave. However, I urged her that I could do better a second time and did it perfectly.

Students who passed proceeded into a dark small freezer room with tall metal racks filled with cardboard boxes and various white various plates above the shelves featuring the entire bodies of small sea creatures and heads of sea monsters. We were tasked with choosing one to take down and cook. After making audible disgusted noises she told me to leave since I wasn't chef material and everyone needed to be comfortable with preparing all kinds of meat.
