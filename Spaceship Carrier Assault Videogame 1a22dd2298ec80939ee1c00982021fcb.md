# Description

Immersed in a fictional RTS video game, each player was given a hovering spaceship that allowed them in a menu to assign one modular utility room on the back like a barracks, medic bay, troop transport area, and radar. Each base resided in two symmetrical sets of four islands surrounded by mountainous rings with a small entrance. After disembarking onto another territory, some enemy artillery units ambushed from behind on the beach, firing at my recently erected defensive turret. Wanting to protect it, I distributed a row of artillery and tanks that focused fire to neutralize the threat.
