# Description

I was one of many secondary students training to become submariners in the Australian army.

In the first class, we were seated in two groups on both sides of a computer lab as a teacher taught the lesson at the front. Three students decided to fool around by flashing porn on their monitors for others to see. I thought to myself that I don’t want to be paired with them so I don’t risk being killed.

In the second class, I entered a midget submarine beside brick docks with a balding 90 year old mentor. The submarine featured:

- A gear shifter like an automatic car with a button on the back that slowed down the submarine.
- A lever to ascend and descend.

I was practicing diving and surfacing but the mentor didn’t realize I was 30 centimetres away from a cliff and I sharply turned right to avoid a collision.

In the third class, everyone was assigned into teams to qualify for the military and simultaneously sent on a four kilometre two lap journey across the Brisbane River with a curve in the middle. I was paired with Eldon and Liam. I was the initial pilot and parked at a port on the other side where we exited to meet a supervisor and got back in to return. I offered to let Eldon drive back and he agreed. While travelling, Liam illuminated a paper map of the river with a flashlight and tried to determine our current location by tracing our journey with a pencil.

After everyone arrived, the instructor showed the results on a noticeboard and we came last, tied with another team with the same time of 11 minutes and 4 seconds. Some team with Brooke managed to complete it all in 6 minutes which we thought was impossible. Since Brooke performed well on all tests she was qualified to join the military but everyone else had to continue training.
