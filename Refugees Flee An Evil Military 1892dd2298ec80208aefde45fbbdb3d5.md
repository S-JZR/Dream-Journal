# Description

I was one of many refugees fleeing soldiers invading a city towards a harbour they controlled. Arriving at a cluster of small two-story square buildings within a desert biome, we ascended a square staircase winding around the interior, eventually finding concealment behind a wall in an upstairs room. Peering through a rectangular opening in the left side of the wall, I spotted a military figure climbing the staircase to investigate. Instinctively, I maneuvererd through a square window on the left side, descending from awnings with the refugees following suit. Eventually, we reached a border crossing managed by the same military group connected to the harbour. After presenting our identification, we were promptly granted entry.

Navigating a metal detection area ahead, a guard unexpectedly offered their firearm. Suspicion crept in, prompting me to survey the surroundings. Questioning their motive, they casually explained it as a gift for regional safety. Capitalizing on the moment, I grabbed the firearm and attempted to discharge it on him, only to find it was unloaded. Realizing their intentional ploy, Jackie Chan's tearful face materialized, exclaiming, "Now I understand, you were testing if I was a rebel."

To alter the course of events, I returned to the initial border crossing, noticing only one soldier stationed at the entry booths. Other soldiers on a nearby balcony were engrossed in casual conversations, their view obstructed by a wall around the corner. Exploiting the opportunity, I grabbed a metal shovel from a barrel, repeatedly striking the back of his head until he slumped unconscious, then donned his blue uniform. Uniforms were color-coded, with sky blue indicating lower ranks and dark green for higher ranks. Adopting the disciplined gait of a soldier, I blended in seamlessly while navigating tight turns. A training area caught my attention, where personnel in blue uniforms practiced marching on a chalk oval drawn on the pavement. After a brief stint, I discreetly entered an adjacent building outside, only to stumble upon a high-ranking official descending a staircase alone. Questioned about my presence, I drew a pistol and fired multiple shots at his head and chest until he fell silent.

Recognising that the gunfire likely attracted attention, I fled to a secluded laboratory nestled in a corner of the compound. Ascending to an exterior roof with a sniper rifle bolted to it, I witnessed a distressed teenager strapped down as a scientist drilled a metallic object into their arm. Despite repeated pleas for pain killers, the scientist claimed there was none left and continued.

Lockdown sirens played loudly, prompting everyone to gather at a central location. Recognizing the peril of my identity being exposed through security camera footage and wanting to avoid drawing attention while alone outside, I quickly unscrewed the sniper rifle with my bare hands to arm myself and escaped through an alternative exterior gate.
