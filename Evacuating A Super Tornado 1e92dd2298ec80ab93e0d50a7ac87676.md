# Description

I was walking along the path with an awning to the top oval beside the administration building of my primary school when a powerful tornado formed in the distance. A nearby teacher pointed it out, yelled at everyone to flee to cover, and a tornado siren played over the speakers. The oval was mostly empty, but three students were still running back in terror. The tornado began sucking up terrain directly beneath it, turning brown as debris spiralled upward.

I pulled out my phone, tapped the screen to ensure it was focused, and took three centred horizontal photos. I regretted not moving closer to remove the side poles from the frame. As I fled to my old year 7 classroom, where various people were gathering, loud thunder shook the ground and a blonde student said there must be a supercell above us. I was about to check the live weather radar on my phone when teachers announced that buses were coming to evacuate us, but I was worried they wouldn’t arrive in time.
