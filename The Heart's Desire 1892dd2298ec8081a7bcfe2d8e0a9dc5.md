# Description

I was ascending the stairs of a skyscraper without windows except for the top floor which led into an empty room with a giant red 3D love heart at the centre. During the journey, a disembodied voice explained that many people are distracted by the symptoms of societal problems, overlooking the root cause which lies in the desires of one's heart.

While crossing the minor road of a T-junction at 68 Manning Street in South Brisbane, a homeless man went across the main road to punch a bearded bald man in the face as he walked alongside his friends. After briefly wrestling, the bearded man knocked him out with a punch to the forehead as he collapsed motionless on the ground. I initially pulled out my phone but hesitated to call for an ambulance, wondering if he would do it himself as he fiddled with his phone before finally doing it.
