# Description

After contemplating the concept of total combinations for ideas and choices, it became clear that only legible and practical permutations would prove significant. In the city, a group of adults dressed in tuxedos sat in grey folding metal chairs arranged in a grid formation with equal gaps between them positioned behind a projector screen. They were transfixed with mouths agape as a series of random black QR codes exploring unique combinations on a white background flashed on-screen accompanied by white noise, as bypassers stood mystified by the strange ordeal.
