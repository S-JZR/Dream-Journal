# Description

I was contemplating the concept of total combinations for ideas and choices when I realized that only legible and practical permutations would prove significant.

In a city a group of adults dressed in tuxedos sat in grey folding metal chairs arranged in a grid formation with equal gaps between them positioned behind a projector screen. They were transfixed with mouths agape as a series of random black QR codes exploring unique combinations on a white background flashed on-screen accompanied by white noise, as bypassers stood mystified by the strange ordeal.

- I watched an online video about the The Library Of Babel. Some personal thoughts were mixed in.
