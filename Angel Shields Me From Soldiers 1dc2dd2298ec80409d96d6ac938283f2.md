# Description

I was walking to the other side of the carpark in my unit complex as an almost invisible orange angel with outstretched wings levitated in front of me and faced a distant line of soldiers equipped with machine guns. The soldiers opened fire but I was unharmed as the bullets instantly disappeared when hitting the angel.
