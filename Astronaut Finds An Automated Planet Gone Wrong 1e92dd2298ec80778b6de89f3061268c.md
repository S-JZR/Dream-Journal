# Description

A blond astronaut was travelling through space in an egg-shaped camouflaged spaceship with four landing legs, trying to reach a destination. The entire time, he was in a radio call with other crew members at a remote HQ as the signal relayed across a chain of distant satellites. After accidentally getting lost, he encountered a red, green, and two grey planets that displayed on internal monitors. The green planet showed excessive signs of life covering the entire surface when scanned. Upon landing, it was discovered that Creepers from Minecraft had bred uncontrollably and covered the surface to conceal the grey stone beneath. The loud noise of the rocket scared them away into various nearby cave entrances where they couldn’t completely fit inside but eventually came out again to curiously surround it as he observed them through the hemisphere windows. The onboard AI system advised him not to open the door for his personal safety until it could be confirmed that they were not a threat. He requested backup to be on standby in case an emergency evacuation was needed.

A hostile faction discovered the astronaut was on the planet and dispatched a dropship that deployed a male dark jedi wearing black clothes, chains, and wielding a red lightsabre to assassinate him. After fleeing across a series of mountains, white robot lazer sentries scattered across them recognised a human in distress and opened fire at the dark jedi who was significantly delayed by reflecting the shots back to destroy them. The astronaut updated his status to an urgent distress call.

He trespassed into a large restricted white ring-shaped storage facility resembling Apple HQ. The outer rim featured a wide illuminated hallway with a grey carpet and panelled windows on both sides. The inner rim featured a warehouse with thousands of tall metal shelves with rectangular dark grey storage boxes. A levitating white disc robot with a sniper rifle underneath patrolled the hallway and immediately opened fire at him. While fleeing, he discovered a male survivor hiding among shelves in the hallway who begged to be rescued, prompting him to calculate a safe route to escape. As a rounded white rectangular vehicle robot with headlights, a gun, and a scanner approached from the other side, they entered the dark warehouse, where many others were patrolling. When the robot came near, they opened two empty rectangular storage containers on the bottom shelves and climbed inside to lay down motionless. The creates opened from the sides and had an illuminated internal strip that activated each time they were opened. The robot scanned their bodies with a blue triangular beam and continued moving.

After exiting the facility through a fire exit, they ascending to the roof as other crew arrived, one of which was Carter from Rush Hour, wearing fully-body dark grey armour. He sassily tried to reason with the AI system embedded in the planet by talking to a sniper turret on a distant roof. Five separate shots, each with a brief pause between them, struck his chest plate and helmet, knocking him back repeatedly. However, he kept moving back into position to defiantly yell insults at it. The astronaut radioed him saying, “What the hell are you doing? Stop standing in the open! Are you trying to get yourself killed?” Carter then moved out of sight behind roof structures.

As the astronaut and survivor descended the stairs to cross a large flat outdoor loading bay, the dark jedi emerged from behind to chase them. The survivor was fatally stabbed in the chest and the astronaut tripped onto the ground then turned to plead “Please don't kill me”. The dark jedi replied, "I sense darkness in you. Will you join the dark side?”
