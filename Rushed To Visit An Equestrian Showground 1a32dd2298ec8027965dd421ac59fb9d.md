# Description

My dad decided to drive me to see the new attractions at the stores down the road which had transformed into an open Equestrian Showground. While rushing to leave the toilet without finishing, I nervously wiped my buttocks with tissues in the backseat with my pants down, hoping he wouldn't notice, and planned to discard them in the bin upon arrival. Different riders performed tricks with their horses, gradually increasing the difficulty until raising the jump rail to an absurd two meters when one rider hesitated with a lack of confidence. One white horse ridden by a man had a pink mane.
