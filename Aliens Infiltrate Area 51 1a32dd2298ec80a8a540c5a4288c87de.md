# Description

Aliens infiltrated Area 51 during my night shift to covertly brainwash some staff members. The situation escalated when they assaulted the control room by teleporting a malicious robot resembling Robby from Forbidden Planet inside. Panic ensued as everyone rushed to the front doors, only to find them jammed. The doors suddenly opened, revealing pale, mind-controlled individuals with sinister smirks.

Hearing screams and gunfire outside, an armed squad, including myself and a robot resembling a Titan from Metal Arms equipped with dual miniguns, arrived to open fire on the robot and aliens. When an alien emerged from behind outside, our robot swivelled and unleashed a barrage of fire, making it fall to the ground dead.
