# Description

I was one of many soldiers working the night shift at Area 51 when aliens infiltrated. They brainwashed some staff members and assaulted the control room by teleporting a malicious robot resembling Robby from Forbidden Planet inside. Panic ensued as everyone rushed to the front doors, only to find them jammed. The doors suddenly opened, revealing pale, mind-controlled individuals with sinister smirks.

After hearing screams and gunfire I travelled with the squad and a robot resembling a Titan from Metal Arms equipped with dual miniguns to open fire on the robot and aliens. When an alien emerged from behind outside, our robot swivelled and unleashed a barrage of fire, making it fall to the ground dead.
