# Description

I was at an arcade when a staff member invited me to participate in a more modern laser tag experience on a hollow rectangular prism platform in a sky void. It involved navigating a hovering obstacle course comprising grey blocks and ladders arranged in an oval formation until reaching a towering black brick castle on a floating island.

After ascending the stairs into a large room with dimly lit theatrical curtains at the front, a levitating giant eyeball emerged with a black pupil that transformed to glow red as it fired a series of narrow purple energy waves across the floor towards us. Realizing it would be easier to hit us if we stood together, I told everyone to spread out throughout the room. We had the choice to either shoot back or hold full-body ballistic shields to block attacks.

Eventually, we defeated the boss and continued ascending the stairs. Someone claimed to have heard there were 300 levels in total and this is the first one. While looking through a window, I caught a glimpse of a much higher obstacle course.
