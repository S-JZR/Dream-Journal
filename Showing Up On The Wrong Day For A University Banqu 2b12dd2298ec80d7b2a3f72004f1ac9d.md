# Description

I was walking upstairs in a fancy building to a university class banquet where many students sat with their clients at long tables with course codes on A4 paper taped to the side.

> **Woman**: Where are my students?
> 

> **Woman**: Don’t they know that attendance is mandatory for such an important occasion!?
> 

I was confused by two tables with unit codes close to mine, one empty and full. I approached a female teacher at the full table.

> **Me**: Excuse me which table is for my class?
> 

> **Teacher**: Your class starts next week.
