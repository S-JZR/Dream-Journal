# Description

I was walking upstairs in a fancy building to a university class banquet where many students sat with their clients at long tables with course codes on A4 paper taped to the side. One client distressed by a missing member adamantly stated attendance is mandatory for such an important occasion. Confused by two tables with unit codes close to mine, one empty and full, I asked teachers at the full one about my class, as they claimed it started next week.
