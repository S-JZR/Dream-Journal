# Description

I was in a black void worried that not pursuing an engineering degree would prevent me from making a lasting impact in the world and I considered switching to it. However, I realized:

- It’s likely impractical at this point since I have nearly completed my double degree.
- It would further delay me from entering the workforce.
- I lacked the necessary math and physics knowledge to easily transition.
- A safer alternative could be trialling a one year certificate or focusing on my current field.
