# Description

I was one of many guests dressed in fancy clothing descending stairs at night to attend a party in a building below the street. Later criminals emerged to spray green sleeping gas everywhere and assaulted guests. I tried rescuing everyone by shooting the criminals with a pistol but was knocked unconscious on the back of the head.

After awakening on a pile of trash in the entrance room, dressed in batman’s armour, three female thugs gathered around and asked what happened to some of their colleagues. I admitted to shooting them all and they were annoyed.

A masked villain, dressed in a dark green robe entered the room and began spraying gas everywhere and chased me. I held my breath, covering my nose with my arm, and ascended the staircase outside to the main street. Spotting a couple of grenades scattered across the floor, I pulled the pins and threw them back, hoping they would ignite the gas. However, it had no effect, and with the villain emerging, I fled the area.
