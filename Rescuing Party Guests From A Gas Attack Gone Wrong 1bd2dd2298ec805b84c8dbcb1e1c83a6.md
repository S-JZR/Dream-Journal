# Description

I descended stone stairs below street level to a party on the first floor of a building where a few criminals were spraying green sleeping gas everywhere and assaulting guests. I tried rescuing everyone by shooting at the criminals with a pistol but was knocked out.

After awakening on a pile of trash in the entrance room, dressed in batman’s armour, a couple of women gathered around and asked what happened to some criminals they knew. I told them I shot them all and they were not impressed.

A masked villain, dressed in a dark green robe entered the room and began spraying gas everywhere and chased me. I held my breath, covering my nose with my arm, and ascended the staircase outside to the main street. Spotting a couple of grenades scattered across the floor, I pulled the pins and threw them back, hoping they would ignite the gas. However, it had no effect, and with the villain emerging, I fled the area.
