# Description

A woman struggling with depression knocked on my unit's front door and eagerly offered to power-wash bricks in the backyard for payment. Despite being somewhat displeased with the high cost, my parents sympathetically agreed and helped carry the equipment through the house. However, halfway through completion, the water abruptly stopped, and she expressed a disinterest in continuing before leaving. Recognizing that she was experiencing a depressive episode, we refrained from criticizing her work.
