# Description

I was spectating a military propaganda commercial featuring shots of diverse people performing basic jobs like selling fruit at a marketplace on the footpath beside Brisbane City.

> **Worker 1**: I work to kill dictators overseas.
> 

> **Worker 1**: [Dictator name]
> 

> **Worker 2**: [Dictator name]
> 

> **Worker 3**: [Dictator name]
> 

> **Narrator**: Society is merely a façade artificially manufactured to comfort the masses from the true reality that everything can be easily destroyed in war.
> 

> **Narrator**: The greatest underlying objective is always survival by remaining the fittest.
> 

> **Narrator**: Achieving permanent liberty requires collaborating to overcome international threats that seek to dominate by perpetually scheming against us.
> 

> **Narrator**: Every action, including those that seem inconsequential, should be done with the vision of achieving something greater and doing any part to uphold the nation contributes to fighting against the enemy.
> 

> **Narrator**: If you're not highly skilled then serve the public to help the disciplined go on to innovate for the future and profits can be used to invest in worthwhile causes.
> 

A medium full shot of a machine gun rack in a grey room showed three soldiers wearing grey uniforms power walking past it in a line to arm themselves and turning 90 degrees to the right to exit the frame.

> **Narrator**: There is no peace while the wicked prosper.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Thoughts:
    - I feel like so many things in society are trivial and stupid.
    - I fear that as populations, knowledge, and technology grows it will increase the destructive potential of malicious individuals and nations.
    - I fear that as a last resort we need to become powerful enough to uproot malicious systems in their relative infancy but it could easily backfire.
- Christianity:
    - The motto seems like a distortion of Isaiah 57:20-21 to justify executing God’s wrath ourselves.

## Symbols

- Façade:
    - I feel peace between nations is superficial and maintained by the threat of mutually assured destruction.
    - I feel like entertainment distracts people from the harshness of reality, dumbs them down, and stops them from pursuing higher ambitions.
    - I feel luxury is meaningless without safety to enjoy it and our survival should be more important than fleeting status, materialism, and entertainment.
    - Without achieving last peace it's inevitable that we're on a countdown to the next tragedy.
- Destroyed In War:
    - All locations can be easily targeted in war so nowhere is truly safe and total war will drag everyone down.
- Nations Scheming:
    - Beneath the surface malicious nations still scheme ways to become dominant and overthrow each other.
- Survival Of The Fittest:
    - If it weren’t for people sacrificing their time to become knowledgeable and develop powerful weaponry to protect us then we would of all been destroyed because we were not the fittest.
- Call To War:
    - Angry at the injustice caused by dictators harming innocent people.
    - In general I feel like everyone could achieve something greater, transcend our current limitations, and bring lasting change if we were all focused on meaningful things, disciplined, and rejected mediocrity.

## Lessons

- Survival should be valued more than luxury.

# Notes

- I don’t want to name anyone to avoid inciting violence.
