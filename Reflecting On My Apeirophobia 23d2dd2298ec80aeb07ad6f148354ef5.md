# Description

I was walking with CaseOh down to the Mt Gravatt bus station when he asked the chat on his phone “What is the scariest thing you’ve ever seen?” I started sharing my experience with apeirophobia which used to give me depression.

I transformed into Alan Seawright from Cinema Therapy and Jonathan Decker realized he didn't know something about him and jokingly said “It has a name?” I said the fear of infinity was literally driving me insane but what was strange is that it wasn’t for a lack of logical reasoning and the arguments were plausible but also unprovable. They may never happen or unfold that way in the future but I was fixated on the possibility that they could and essentially trapping myself in a box of my own creation. Worrying about it got me nowhere and did nothing to resolve the problem.
