# Description

I was walking with CaseOh down to the Mt Gravatt bus station when he asked the chat on his phone “What is the scariest thing you’ve ever seen?” and I started sharing my experience with apeirophobia.

I transformed into Alan Seawright from Cinema Therapy and Jonathan Decker realized he didn't know something about him and jokingly said “It has a name?” I said the fear of infinity was literally driving me insane but what was strange is that it wasn’t for a lack of logical reasoning and the arguments were plausible but also unprovable. They may never happen or unfold that way in the future but I was fixated on the possibility that they could and essentially trapping myself in a box of my own creation. Worrying about it got me nowhere and did nothing to resolve the problem.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Thoughts:
    - I used to have a strong fear of infinity about things like:
        - The implications of living forever. Never reaching an end. Being unable to comprehend infinity. Having an expectation to be conscious forever. Trivializing our human identity and what we value. The fear of things falling apart.
        - Does true infinity exist? Can we achieve infinite experiences or are we limited to a finite cycle?
- Online Videos:
    - References Alan and Jonathan bantering with each other and sharing personal stories.

## Symbols

- CaseOh:
    - Feeling like most people are caught up in shallow thinking and oblivious to life’s complexities.
- Therapist:
    - Wanting to reflect on my experiences and concerns.

## Lessons

- We worry more about what might happen than what actually does.
- Don't limit yourself by thinking you know everything and rigidly defining what is possible.
- Comprehending infinity is impossible for finite minds so don't try it.
