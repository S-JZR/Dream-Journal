# Description

At dusk, with dark clouds overhead, I was on a wooden pier with various students changing into four vibrant solid-colour sports uniforms. After leaving the locker room, I headed towards the bridge and overheard an Asian student expressing concerns to the supervisor about his inability to swim. The supervisor reassured him that all activities were on land and spectators only needed to cheer for their teams, as the student smiled and confirmed his understanding.

I tried sprinting to a crowd of students searching for their teams across the pier, but steel plating around my legs impeded my movement. Eventually, hearing someone call my name, I desperately looked around and locked eyes with a bald, bearded male teacher outside a supermarket who gestured for me to approach. He assigned an opponent to each team member. The first and only activity I participated in was a fencing duel fought with European longswords. The anxiety of blocking attacks to avoid injuries led me to forfeit. In another round, my partner and I accidentally injured the supervisor.

We combined our equipment into a mecha to escape the consequences and flew over nearby canyons. Eventually, an alert message notified us that the supervisor was in critical condition and needed urgent medical attention. Feeling guilty, we turned back, only to realize the fuel tanks were empty. We landed beside a straight road, disassembled into our human forms, and began walking back on foot. During the journey, I felt the urge to flirt with my female partner by asking if anyone had ever mentioned how beautiful she was, but my anxiety choked me at the last word.
