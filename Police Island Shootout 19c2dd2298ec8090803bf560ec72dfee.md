# Description

I was one of many police officers dispatched to a distress call on an island with a skyscraper beside coastal cities. Upon arriving at a long textured stone pier with an awning and loose rocks on both sides, a man behind a distant art installation opened fire on us. We took cover behind nearby red metal poles as bullets struck them repeatedly. While taking turns to return fire, I was hit in the shoe, severing my toe, and I accidentally pulled the trigger too early as another bullet ricocheted off the pole into my leg.

After the battle concluded, we travelled to Logan Paul’s house located in unit 5 at my unit complex and knocked on the backdoor window. After he approached with a few guests standing beside him we spoke through the glass about seeking refuge, prompting him to open the door. While walking down the stairs of an enlarged fancy interior, I explained to Mr Beast about my injuries and how I had to have my toe sewn back on.
