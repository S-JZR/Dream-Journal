# Description

I was standing on a small sandbank near the coast with TV presenters when we reshaped it into a large C-shaped island and decorated it with furniture. Eventually, everyone began discussing a recent sex scandal involving one of the members. After propagating the gossip on a talk show elsewhere, it was eventually revealed to be a misunderstanding, with the stories being unrelated to the same individual.
