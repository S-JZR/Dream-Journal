# Description

Near the coast with TV presenters on a small circular flat sandbank, we began shifting sand to expand it into a c-shape decorated with furniture. Eventually, everyone began discussing a recent sex scandal involving one of the members. After propagating the gossip on a talk show elsewhere, it was eventually revealed to be a misunderstanding, with the stories being unrelated to the same individual.
