# Description

I was one of many contestants on a game show resembling "Would I Lie To You?" sharing a personal story as other participants guessed whether it was real or fake. I shared a tale about getting shot in the leg while working on a farm but realized I'd strayed far from the host's recommended scenario card received earlier, so I stuck with it to seem authentic.

Suddenly, I was transported into a vivid re-enactment, seated on a tractor beside a highway, urgently driving to the nearest hospital as blood flowed from my injured leg. A group of fictional friends tended to the wound while I drove since nobody had experience using manual gears. The tractor unexpectedly halted, flinging us through the front windshield onto shards of glass scattered across the road. The experience shifted into a cinematic view, where I warned my mother not to watch as the tractor regained momentum and flattened anyone in its path. However, everyone was unharmed, and we continued on foot. Eventually, we arrived at a desolate hospital featuring partially illuminated halls with random pitch-black areas and non-functional elevators. The absence of alarms made us suspect they were deactivated. Fearing someone had terrorized the place, we debated whether it was better to search for supplies elsewhere. After reasoning that time was running out to save me and that this might not be a localized event, we decided to quickly check rooms for supplies before leaving.

Upon reaching the fifth floor, echoes of shuffling filled the stairwell, but the darkness obscured what lurked below. I hurled a pebble down a steel pipe extending between each floor to elicit a response. After a brief silence, distant rumbling grew louder, and black tentacles slithered over the second-floor railings as the creature ascended each step. Overwhelmed with terror, we bolted ahead to distance ourselves from it. On the top floor, we realized the hospital was taken over by military personnel periodically patrolling a specific area. We ventured into a large, empty concrete room and witnessed soldiers placing a mysterious machine into a vault that sealed itself with a thick steel door. I instinctively knew that accessing the vault was the only way back to reality. A vigilant sentry caught us trespassing and impulsively pointed a pistol at us. After explaining our intentions, he lowered his weapon. Suddenly, we were armed, and the vault opened as a couple of soldiers stepped out into the room. Opting to avoid a confrontation, we walked backwards out of the room while pointing guns at them. An Asian figure, one of my fictional friends from earlier, emerged from behind with a white towel wrapped around his waist and a bandana across his forehead. He explained that he would cover our escape while standing in the doorway. Word of the incident spread, and we proceeded down the right side of a forked corridor with offices featuring glass walls as soldiers approached from where we came. We continued walking backwards until hearing the creature from earlier rummaging through items behind us as it got closer.
