# Description

I was with various secondary students on an excursion detouring to a sushi buffet spread across multiple large warehouses. Everyone moved through aisles and hallways made of metal shelves with price tags to place items on their plate and at the end a team of 100 chefs would cook everything in an open commercial kitchen.

I was concerned about:

- Health risks with frozen meat left out on the metal shelves.
- Health risks from almost empty sauce bottles left on the metal shelves.
- High prices. I used a $2 single-serve of white rice in a transparent plastic packet as a cheap base.
- I overloaded my plate with sauce which filled the bottom and didn’t know how the chefs would manage it.
