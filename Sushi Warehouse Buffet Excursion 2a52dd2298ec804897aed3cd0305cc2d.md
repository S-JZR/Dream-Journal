# Description

I was one of many secondary students on an excursion detouring to a sushi buffet distributed across multiple large warehouses to buy lunch. Everyone moved through aisles and hallways made of metal shelves with price tags to place items on their plate and at the end a team of 100 chefs would cook everything in an open commercial kitchen.

I was concerned about:

- Health risks with frozen meat left out on the shelves.
- Health risks from almost empty sauce bottles left on the shelves.
- High prices. I used a $2 single-serve of white rice in a transparent plastic packet as a cheap base.
- The bottom of my place was filled with sauce and I didn’t know how the chefs would manage it.
