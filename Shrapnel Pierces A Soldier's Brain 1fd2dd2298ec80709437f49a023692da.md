# Description

A timid male soldier was cowering among crates in a small shed missing its back half some distance behind the frontline when an officer approached to order him to advance forward. However, an artillery shell unexpectedly landed nearby and a metal fragment about 0.5cm wide ricocheted off the ground, boring a hole upward through the soldier’s nasal skin, and lodging slightly in his brain. He panicked at the sensation of the hot metal, fearing it would leave him disabled and require surgery.
