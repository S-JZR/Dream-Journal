# Description

I was in a room with various elderly people as we all laid in sleeping bags arranged in a ring. The woman to my left contentedly said, "I have lived a good life," as her flesh rapidly disintegrated into nothing until only a skeleton remained.

# Interpretations

- I constantly worry about not reaching my full potential.
- I dislike people who accept living mundane lives.

## Symbols

- Elderly Woman: the fear of living a mundane life and not achieving anything significant.
- Death: the fear of death.

## Lessons

- Live intentionally and don’t wait until it’s too late.
