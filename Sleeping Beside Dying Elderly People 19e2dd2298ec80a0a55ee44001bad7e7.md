# Description

I was with many elderly people in a room lying in sleeping bags in a ring formation. The woman to my left said, "I have lived a good life," as her flesh rapidly disintegrated into nothing until only a skeleton remained.

# Interpretations

    - Likely references “The End” episode where Tim, Graeme, and Bill are trapped in their office for decades and Bill lies under an orange blanket beside their skeletons.

    - I constantly worry about not reaching my full potential.
    - I dislike people who accept living mundane lives.

## Symbols

    - The fear of living a mundane life.

    - The fear of death.

## Lessons

- Live intentionally and don’t wait until it’s too late.
