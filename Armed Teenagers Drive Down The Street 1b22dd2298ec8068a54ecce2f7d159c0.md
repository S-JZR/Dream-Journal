# Description

I was standing on the footpath outside of my unit complex at night when a group of mischievous male and female teenagers in a brown-red Toyota drove past. They leaned outside all four side door windows, holding raised machine guns and yelling like lunatics to amuse themselves, so I fled back inside.
