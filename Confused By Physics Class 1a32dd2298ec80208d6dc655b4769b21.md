# Description

While seated in physics class next to Patrick, a top student, the teacher illustrated various mathematical equations on the whiteboard with diverse symbols like theta, without any reasoning, leaving me stumped. Thinking this was a mere one-off occurrence, I attended another lesson, now hosted in the art room, but it was still confusing, as even Brooke, another top student, thought it was counterproductive, so we left halfway through.
