# Description

I was seated in physics class at my secondary school next to Patrick, a top student, when the teacher illustrated various mathematical equations on the whiteboard without any reasoning, leaving me stumped. Thinking this was a mere one-off occurrence, I attended another lesson, now hosted in the art room, but it was still confusing, as even Brooke, another top student, thought it was counterproductive, so we left halfway through.
