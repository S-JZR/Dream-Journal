# Description

I was standing on a flat sandy area in the ocean on a gameshow with various cartoon fish contestants. Two shark commentators were seated behind a wooden bench and wore headsets.

> **Harry**: Good morning and welcome to the annual peeing competition, coming to you live from the Sandy Flats!
**Jack**: That’s right Harry! I simply can’t wait to see everything unfold and it looks like we have a few new faces trying to make their mark!
**Harry**: Let’s take a look at the field.
**Harry**: Word is in that everything is all set and they’re off!
> 

After the airhorn sounded I tried my best to win.
