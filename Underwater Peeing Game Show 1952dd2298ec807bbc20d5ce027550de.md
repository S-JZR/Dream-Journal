# Description

I was in the ocean on a gameshow with various cartoon fish contestants. Two shark commentators were seated behind a wooden bench and wore headsets as they hyped viewers by introducing the competition of who could pee the most. When the timer started, I did my best to try to win, but I woke up in the morning to discover I had wet the bed.
