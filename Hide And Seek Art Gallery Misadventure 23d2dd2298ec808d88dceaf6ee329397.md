# Description

I was one of many secondary students playing hide and seek in the school when I considered hiding on a roof since it would be less obvious due to being inaccessible. However, I skipped the roof of a major building since it would attract too much attention and proceeded further to a metal staircase leading to a higher floor with an awning. I didn’t climb the exterior since there was a long drop. I kept searching upstairs and encountered a spacious art gallery with grey walls, a wooden floor, and a few paintings on the walls.

I travelled to a carpeted back room:

- Centre:
    - Row of flannel dividers.
- Right:
    - Row of computers.

The co female art teacher was tearing up photocopies of people’s artwork, including mine, and painting over them to create a new art piece pinned to the flannel dividers. An Indian student from primary school said that I still had their file called “Apollo” and I realized earlier they meant a document and not the god.

I sat at a computer and plugged in my USB as the teacher sat left of me overlooking everything. I soon realized the system was infected with a virus that displayed random memes and bizarre images across the screen. I told her to ignore it since I wasn’t responsible and loaded the computer in safe mode. I opened a file database GUI but couldn’t locate the file.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- During secondary school the art teachers taped decorative black paper borders to our drawings without consent for the Art Galas and I feared removing them would tear the drawings.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- Don't risk your life over trivial matters.
- Mistakes can lead to opportunities we wouldn’t have discovered otherwise.
