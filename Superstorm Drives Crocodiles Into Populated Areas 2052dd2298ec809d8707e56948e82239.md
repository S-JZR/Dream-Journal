# Description

A superstorm passed over Queensland, Australia during the night, causing various wild animals to move into populated areas. The next day, I walked onto the grass oval at my secondary school to witness three gigantic 10 meter long crocodiles laying idle on their bellies beside each other with a gap between them. Red and white hazard tape formed a rectangular perimeter around them with padding inside. One had wandered slightly outside the taped area.

When returning to my unit at night, I was worried about my dad trying to get into his card to drive to nightshift work with wild animals around and considered leaving a warning on a note. While scrolling through social media on my phone, I saw various night-time videos, including AI generated monster clips that I skipped, and different people documenting large crocodiles on their properties. One showed someone opening their second storey water-textured sliding glass window to film a crocodile on the grass when it suddenly darted towards them, trying to climb the exterior wall to get inside, so they instinctively slammed the window shut to keep it out.

After putting my phone down, I scanned the surroundings outside with a flashlight from right to left and saw a deer sleeping while standing on its two hind legs outside the door of unit 4. The light shinning in its eyes woke it up and it slowly turned its head toward me. Concerned for my safety, I went back inside and shut both the flyscreen and wooden doors, which were transparent only for me. It waddled over to the front door and I was shocked to see it knowing how to look through the peephole at me. It transformed into a woman holding an electronic device resembling a PDA with an antenna as she moved over to the vertical blinds, trying to discover if aliens were inside by scanning the heat signatures of my family but to no avail.
