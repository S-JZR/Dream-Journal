# Description

Whilst walking with my family down the street of a fictional metropolitan city, parallel to another elevated above boulders descending into the ocean, I noticed a towering white cylindrical ski lift carrying individuals vertically into the air via moving hooks, then overhead across various buildings to another unseen location. A middle-aged female bystander noticing my apprehension, jokingly asked whether I wanted to go for a ride to which I strongly declined. Having booked tickets for a ferry previously, we entered the terminal and followed a bearded captain struggling to locate his ship. Traversing over floating bridges, he led us to a small sailboat but claimed that was not it before proceeding left to a desaturated long oval sandbag resembling Shrek, with a 3D model of his face on the front.

A few other individuals also wanted to board, including Gordan Ramsay, who swore profusely at the mediocre experience as everyone struggled to cram together without spaces. Eventually, the captain initiated an embedded engine as we traversed further into the ocean, while the backmost person clung tightly onto others, trying not to fall off. For whatever reason, we emerged on a stage in front of a live audience, seeking to ascend the stairs of each row while a shallow stream of water cascaded down. The captain requested that all passengers use their legs to step up in a rhythmic fashion as nearby crowds began laughing.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I recently heard about the Willy's Chocolate Experience scam [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy's_Chocolate_Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy%27s_Chocolate_Experience).
- I’ve watched many online snippets of Gordan Ramsay in Hell’s Kitchen and Hotel Nightmares.

## Symbols

- Ski lift: fear of heights.

## Lessons

- Advertisements can promise anything but what matters is whether they deliver.
