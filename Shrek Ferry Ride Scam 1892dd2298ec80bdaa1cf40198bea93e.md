# Description

I was walking down a street in a seaside city with my family:

- Left:
    - Buildings.
- Right:
    - Riprap beside the ocean.
    - Rectangle harbour with an awning.
- Bottom-right corner:
    - Towering white cylindrical ski lift carried people upward via moving hooks and over the city via a zipline.

A middle-aged woman noticing my apprehension, jokingly asked whether I wanted to ride the ski lift which I strongly declined. Having booked tickets for a ferry previously, we entered the terminal and followed a bearded captain struggling to locate his ship. Traversing over floating bridges, he led us to a small sailboat but claimed that was not it before proceeding left to a desaturated long oval sandbag resembling Shrek, with a 3D model of his face on the front.

A few other individuals also wanted to board, including Gordan Ramsay, who swore profusely at the mediocre experience as everyone struggled to cram together without spaces. Eventually, the captain initiated an embedded engine as we traversed further into the ocean, while the backmost person clung tightly onto others, trying not to fall off. For whatever reason, we emerged on a stage in front of a live audience, seeking to ascend the stairs of each row while a shallow stream of water cascaded down. The captain requested that all passengers use their legs to step up in a rhythmic fashion as nearby crowds began laughing.
