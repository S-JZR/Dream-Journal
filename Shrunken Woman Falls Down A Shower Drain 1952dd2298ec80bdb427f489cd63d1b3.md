# Description

The dream resembled an old greyscale horror film.

A nude woman was taking a shower in a white alcove bathtub with white curtains when suddenly she was struck by lightning bolts emitted from the showerhead, shrinking her to 1 inch tall. Different shots showed her moving down the drain from a high-angle close-up of the hole and an external side view of the pipe. She was in a falling pose on her back with one arm raised and the other down. The shot was overlaid with the eerie waving title “Down The Drain”.
