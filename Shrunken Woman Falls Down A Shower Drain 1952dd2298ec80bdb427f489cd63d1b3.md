# Description

In the style of a greyscale horror film, a nude woman was taking a shower in an alcove tub with white curtains when suddenly she was struck by lightning bolts emitted from the showerhead, shrinking her to 1 inch tall. Different shots showed her moving down the drain from a high-angle close-up of the hole and an external side view of the pipe. She was in a falling pose on her back with one arm raised and the other down. The shot was overlaid with an eerie waving title with the text “Down The Drain”.

# Interpretations

- I think I remember seeing snippets of the main character in The Incredible Shrinking Man fighting off a giant spider as a child when someone was flicking through TV channels which made me feel unsettled and worried about his safety.

## Symbols

- Shrinking: the fear of being helpless.

## Lessons

- N/A.
