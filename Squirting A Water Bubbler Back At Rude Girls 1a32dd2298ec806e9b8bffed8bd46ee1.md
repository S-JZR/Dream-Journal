# Description

I was using the water bubblers outside the sport room toilet block at my primary school when a group of girls from secondary school approached from behind. One girl grew impatient while waiting and splashed a few drops of orange punch from her glass onto the back of my shirt, leaving a stain. In retaliation, I squirted a stream of water back at her by pressing down on the nozzle, making her throw all the contents onto my shirt. After the incident, everything returned to normal, and she asked me to pull the lever of a cylindrical glass beverage dispenser on nearby fold-out table. This caused a pressure change that counterintuitively pumped its contents upwards into a cylindrical dish that she scooped up with a cup then departed.

I attended a parade in the old hall when I spoke to a young Indian student outside on the right side surrounded by the overflow of students.
