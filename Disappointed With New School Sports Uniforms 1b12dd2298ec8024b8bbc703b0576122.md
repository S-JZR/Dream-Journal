# Description

I was at my secondary school during a school assembly in the hall as Mrs Itsikson, a staff member, announced new sports uniforms featuring the new minimalist animal sports team shield icons on solid colour uniforms. The students were displeased with the uniforms and I discussed with Levi’s brother why it was a bad design.

In the middle of the drop off zone, I waited on a wooden bench beside someone for the bus to arrive when I fell asleep. After waking up, I asked if the bus had arrived and they explained it has been parked for five minutes so I rushed over to board it with a few other students. The bus driver, a nonchalant Black man, briefly exited to talk with another driver in a bus further down the road. We grew bored and started rocking the bus side to side by leaning against the interior walls, which amused him when he returned.

Upon arriving at my primary school, students were packing the leftover belongings of past students into rectangular cardboard boxes for them to collect. Levi's brother showed me one he had prepared earlier for me in the backroom and opened it to reveal a partially empty interior with a graphics calculator and a few other pieces of stationery.
