# Description

In the hallway of my secondary school's administration building, Julien and I asked a staff member seated behind a desk where we were supposed to go as most students seemed absent. Annoyed, she informed us it was school sports day and directed us towards a side room to pick an activity for the day.

In the next room, various students were seated as a black student facilitated the process at the front beside a whiteboard displaying a schedule of different events written in marker. The facilitator invited everyone to participate in Indigenous activities called something like "Yugiwah," a name represented by “|| || || || ||”. Everyone agreed and moved to the eating area left of the hall, where it was further elaborated that there were two activities including cooking in a food truck on the left or playing educational video games in a fictional air-conditioned computer lab on the right. The facilitator reassured us not to worry about our choices as it wouldn’t offend indigenous people. I opted to try cooking while everyone else entered the computer lab. As I attempted to whisk an egg and milk in a stainless-steel mixing bowl for a strange recipe, it became clear that I didn’t know what I was doing and switched to the other activity.

- I heard my brother share a story yesterday about how he failed to cook an unusual international recipe when he was younger involving eggs and milk. “Banana snow desert.”: [https://youtu.be/DPXifKoRDRw?si=0yF6zmKEc2cbD-cm](https://youtu.be/DPXifKoRDRw?si=0yF6zmKEc2cbD-cm)
