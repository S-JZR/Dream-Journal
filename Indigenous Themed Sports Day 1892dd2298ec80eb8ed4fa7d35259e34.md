# Description

I was standing in the hallway of the administration building in my secondary school with Julien, my friend, when I asked a female staff member seated behind a desk where we were supposed to go as most students seemed absent. She was annoyed and informed us it was school sports day then directed us towards a side room to pick an activity for the day.

In the next room, various students were seated as a black student facilitated the process at the front beside a whiteboard displaying a schedule of different events written in marker. The facilitator invited everyone to participate in Indigenous activities called something like "Yugiwah," a name represented by “|| || || || ||”. Everyone agreed and moved to the eating area left of the hall, where it was further elaborated that there were two activities including cooking in a food truck on the left or playing educational video games in a fictional air-conditioned computer lab on the right. The facilitator reassured us not to worry about our choices as it wouldn’t offend indigenous people. I opted to try cooking while everyone else entered the computer lab. As I attempted to whisk an egg and milk in a stainless-steel mixing bowl for a strange recipe, it became clear that I didn’t know what I was doing and switched to the other activity.
