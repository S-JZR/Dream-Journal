# Description

I was in a version of Minecraft that someone ported to the PS1 that seemed to only feature blocks with a simple 8x8 resolution.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Minecraft:
    - At the time it was being ported to different platforms (e.g., Xbox and iPad).
- Personal Thoughts:
    - I likely wondered what it would be like if it was released earlier on the PS1 and whether the console could handle it.
