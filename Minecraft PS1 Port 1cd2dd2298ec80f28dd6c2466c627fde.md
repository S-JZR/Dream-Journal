# Description

I was immersed in a Minecraft version that someone ported to the PS1 where all block textures had a simple 8x8 resolution.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I used to play Minecraft a lot.
- At the time Minecraft was being ported to different platforms (e.g., Xbox and iPad) and I probably wondered what it would be like if it was released earlier on the PS1 and whether the console could handle it.

## Symbols

- N/A.
