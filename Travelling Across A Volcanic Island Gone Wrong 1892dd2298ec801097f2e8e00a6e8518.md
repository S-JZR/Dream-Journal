# Description

I was dispatched with a group of people on a weathered ship covered in corrugated metal sheets to a harbour filled with a line-up of many others that previously arrived, tasked with traversing a rectangular strip of land illuminated by moonlight without being caught by a monster. The first area comprised two columns of houses spread across a rural hilly plain. After moving beside a two-metre-wide brick wall in the centre a blind black tall creature began approaching rapidly from afar. While everyone else fled, I remained near the wall, repeatedly climbing over it to change sides, confusing the creature which looped around in semi-circles until someone else got close to lure it away. Eventually, after navigating through buildings to avoid being followed, we proceeded to the final area featuring volcanic terrain with a series of flat boulder steps to cross multiple lava rivers. However, the creature from earlier caught up from behind to slay us.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- I played the Lost Rooms recently and it references gameplay that involves hunting a monster in areas that can resemble the backrooms. The monster can struggle to pathfind around a wall and it can also reference bad AI that is typical in Roblox games.

## Symbols

- N/A.

## Lessons

- You’re not completely safe until you leave the danger zone.
