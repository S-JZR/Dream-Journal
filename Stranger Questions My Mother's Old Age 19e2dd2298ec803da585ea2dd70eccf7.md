# Description

I was walking through a shopping mall hallway with my parents when a middle-age woman approached us. My mum had the same appearance but with completely grey hair.

> **Woman**: Excuse me, would you mind if I asked how old is your mother?
> 

> **Mum**: I am 90 years old.
> 

I felt greatly disturbed knowing she likely had only a few years left to live. My mum noticed my expression and spoke to me.

> **Mum**: What is wrong?
> 

> **Me**: It feels so surreal that I find it difficult to believe.
