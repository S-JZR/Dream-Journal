# Description

I was walking through a wide shopping mall hallway with my parents when a fictional middle-age woman approached to ask how old my mother was who appeared the same age as does now with greying hair but claimed to be 90 years old. This greatly disturbed me, knowing she likely had only a few years left to live. Noticing my expression, my mother asked what was wrong and I replied "it feels so surreal that I find it difficult to believe”.

# Interpretations
