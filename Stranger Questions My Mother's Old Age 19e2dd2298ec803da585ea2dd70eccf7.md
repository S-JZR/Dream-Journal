# Description

I was walking through a shopping mall hallway with my parents when a middle-age woman approached to ask how old my mother was. My mum had the same appearance but with completely grey hair. My mum claimed to be 90 years old. This greatly disturbed me, knowing she likely had only a few years left to live. Noticing my expression, my mother asked what was wrong and I replied "it feels so surreal that I find it difficult to believe”.
