# Description

I collaborated with ghost hunters Sam and Colby on various paranormal expeditions, exploring the depths of different buildings. On one occasion, while descending a square stairwell, we discovered a concrete room with a central drainage grate and stairs in the corner leading to shut maintenance doors, dimly lit by an overhead light. As Sam poured water from a plastic bottle into the grate, a foul stench resembling a rotting corpse swiftly permeated the air. In response, everyone promptly evacuated, worried that a demonic entity had been summoned.

In my secondary school, I stood in the middle of a switchback wheelchair pathway with railings, laid across the grass, connecting the admin payment window to the male bathroom beside the cafeteria. Outside the bathroom entrance was a black metal solo swing with a grey seat, likely intended for the school's theatrical productions, and a red mesh bag containing bananas and oranges. Both items covered the same rectangular surface area. As I conversed with my friend Julien, I noticed oranges in a protruding part of the bag wobbling as the flap lifted. Startled, I asked if he also witnessed the supernatural occurrence as we maintained focus on the objects. Eventually, a seventh grader approached the swing seat, which also wobbled. The commotion drew the attention of those nearby, who crowded around us. Gasps and murmurs spread as the swing rotated like someone was sitting in it. As more people gathered, the swing went berserk, rapidly flipping between a 180-degree bottom-to-top position. Though the previous student risked being struck as the seat veered slightly to the side, he was paralysed with a mixture of immersion and fear. Eventually, the seat dropped for a final time, coming to an abrupt halt and leaving everything in silence. Uncertain of the spirit's whereabouts and wary of its potential to influence the crowd, a black student behind me blurted out, "Nah, f****k that s****t!" Instinctively, everyone bolted toward the chain-link fence of the drop-off zone in front of the school. I shared the peculiar event with others nearby, but they remained sceptical. Undeterred, I posted the story on Reddit, where it received 35 upvotes and 105 downvotes. As students urgently called their parents, cars arrived periodically to evacuate them. Since my parents usually came later, I walked around the right side of the school perimeter to distance myself from the commotion until ascending a tall hill outside the city.

Seeing the sunset, I realized how foolish it was to venture into an unknown location and retraced my steps, taking the left path where a few students were still heading home. I walked past a Satanist, third-wave feminist with purple hair, and a goth. While passing the Satanist, a disembodied telepathic voice urged me to hail Satan as it patiently anticipated conformity. However, I responded from the spirit in my heart with a firm yet casual "No, thank you" before continuing. I also sensed a shared bitterness against God in their hearts, driving them to reject anything associated with him. Eventually, I joined three student peers I knew and continued toward a bridge connecting neighbourhoods over the Pacific Highway as distant howls from a pack of wolves echoed ahead. In response, I explained that reaching our destination required traversing a grove atop the hill. Adamant about reaching safety before nightfall, we arrived at a fictional location combining various places, including an underground bus terminal, an overpass outside the local library, and skyscrapers from Brisbane City.

Observing the horizon, my friends noticed thick black smoke rising from surrounding buildings that materialized gradually. Suddenly, three long military planes soared overhead, firing bursts at skyscrapers and a commercial airliner that exploded and crashed into the ground. Crowds scattered in panic, desperately seeking concealment anywhere. Despite my friends' unanimous decision to relocate to a prearranged spot, an internal feeling instructed me not to follow them and descend into the concrete bus tunnels. This seemed reasonable, considering it would prevent potential injuries from shrapnel if the planes had deployed bombs. Overwhelmed by potentially witnessing people die, I abruptly woke up.
