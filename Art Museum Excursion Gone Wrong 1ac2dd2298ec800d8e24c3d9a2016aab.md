# Description

I was one of many secondary school students from art class on an excursion to tour an art museum in France. As everyone lined up to enter through metal detectors at the reception, a few of us at the back without white gloves realized only those wearing them were allowed to enter. I pulled out various white and light grey plastic bags from my school bag, cut the tops off, and distributed them to the students. They wore them tightly over their hand and moved past, hoping nobody would notice.

For some reason, halfway through the tour, those with fake gloves climbed onto a roof of the building, walked across a wooden plank to another, and hopped in front of windows, trying to find one that was open to get back into the museum.
