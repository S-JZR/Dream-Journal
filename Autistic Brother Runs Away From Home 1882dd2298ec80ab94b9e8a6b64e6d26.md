# Description

I was one of many people running through a city square playing a Star Wars laser tag game. Everyone was armed with lazer machine guns. Michael, a socially introverted autistic teenager who was part of my fictional family, requested a turn before eventually wandering off. After the game ended I travelled to my fictional house in a three-story modern glass building.

> **Mum**: Have you seen Michael?
> 

> **Mum**: He has been gone since yesterday.
> 

> **Mum**: He left the lazer gun at home.
> 

Aware of his tendency to visit neighbours and special places, I embarked on a quest to find him, knocking on doors along the street and asking questions without success. After finding no sign of him, I returned home, inexplicably gaining the superpower to jump atop two fences simultaneously while effortlessly balancing on them. Deciding to return the laser gun from the previous event, I walked towards the city square using straight stairs nestled between neighbours on the hill. However, upon arriving, I discovered a professional 6v6 tournament taking place in a small grass square. Deciding to postpone the task, perhaps to avoid being on camera, I skilfully navigated over fences on my way back home.

A figure resembling an ex-prisoner with a bald head and a distinctive anchor tattoo overlaying their right eyelid, abruptly emerged from around tall hedges near the corner of a garden. Without warning, they drew a handful of throwing knives and began hurling them in my direction, prompting a swift retreat to the safety of my home. Inside the house, I took refuge under a table on the second floor, away from the glass windows.

> **Me**: Don’t open the door for them.
> 

After a brief knock, they departed when their calls went unanswered.

Later a creepy rustic witch adorned with dark grey clothes appeared and the same scenario played out.

We discovered that Michael had strategically planned his whereabouts using hidden files on his computer’s C drive and he eventually returned. Half of the room opened into a theatre below where Michael lay in a bed onstage, battling a severe illness marked by rashes across his face. A fictional sister played a crucial role, aiding him by absorbing half of the sickness. An anime-style ending theme song played, accompanying the surreal scene of individuals adorned in sports attire ascending crumbling clock towers and effortlessly leaping between buildings.
