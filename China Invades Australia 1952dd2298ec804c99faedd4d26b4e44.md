# Description

I was walking down a dirt path with some shrubbery on both sides, between suburbs and a shopping mall when a blackout occurred. A fictional friend called to warn me that China was invading Australia and had launched an attack that severely damaged the power grid nationwide. We spent the next few minutes debating how to handle the situation given that most technology had become useless.
