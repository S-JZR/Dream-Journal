# Description

I was walking along a mowed dirt path in a grassy paddock, between houses, towards a shopping mall when a blackout occurred and a fictional male friend called me.

> **Man**: I just heard on the news that China is invading Australia and launched an attack that severely damaged power grids nationwide.
> 

> **Me**: What do you think we should do?
> 

> **Man**: There is no easy way around it as most tech is useless now and people will probably panic.
> 

> **Man**: Meet me at my place as quick as you can and we can go from there.
