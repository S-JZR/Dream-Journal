# Description

I was seated in the library beside a window facing the front of my secondary school, with my family roaming nearby, when I saw my dad’s old teal Holden Barina being towed away from the grassy parking lot for illegally parking on a concrete slab around a tree. I asked my dad if he was going to intervene but he remained unfazed and didn’t stop it. Initially we thought the school was responsible, but after my family walked along the left and right footpaths outside the school, we realized multiple cars were being towed away.

Everyone affected drove to their property resembling a bus station featuring 10 storey underground rectangular towers with staircases and elevators, and short bridge pathways overlooking a deep area below. The entire group descended in an elevator but I was too slow to enter and took the stairs. The interior walls were concrete and each floor featured a single vertical rectangular window on the left long side. On floor B7 I noticed a man approaching the elevator on the bottom floor to greet them. When I arrived at the bottom floor, he noticed me and started power walking up the stairs, so I ran to the top. Eventually, he moved to other floors to kill isolated individuals and I instinctively knew he was an alien.

After calling the police to relay the situation, a policewoman dressed in red and a white horse with a T-shaped head and hundreds of eyes covering the front of its body showed up. I instinctively knew they were both undercover aliens. I urged her to call for reinforcements, including the FBI and men in black, since an alien was killing people but she was hesitant. She gave an update over a walkie talking saying that a few people died but I yelled “17 people were killed!” into it and she repeated my words. Somehow I could see the horse for what it truly was and it charged after me into a nearby garden with dense shrubbery. I dove into the bushes to hide as it ran over me. However, it seemed to transform all organic matter it touched and eyes began growing on nearby plants so I fled.
