# Description

I was standing in a small carpark when a woman asked me to recall my experiences in a depraved village. I told her it was like The Outlasts Trials run by various psychopaths. Nobody was supposed to be outside during the night as they risked being shot and attacked by anthropomorphic nocturnal mutant deer guards that sluggishly roamed on two legs and held rifles.

A few months ago, I was a a poor man in the same parking lot at night when I noticed a pink piggy bank on the ground. I held it up in both hands as everything faded to white and I was teleported to a remote village containing rundown modern buildings and a forest surrounding the perimeter. I stood outside a few two-storey buildings at the edge of the location and upstairs in a dark messy abandoned industrial room with smashed windows I noticed a woman walking right and disappearing.

I walked further through the village and sought shelter in a small square building:

- left:
    - doorframe with no door
    - small kitchen
    - stacks of wooden planks, nails, and a hammer on the floor
- front:
    - lounge room with a brown sofa
    - two concrete window openings
- back:
    - doorframe with no door.

An eight year old boy was sleeping on the sofa and was commanded to stay there alone for the night by his abusive father. I briefly transformed into a black woman and told him that no matter what happens I would stay with him the whole night except for toilet breaks of course. The boy eventually started to think that I was his new father because he never knew anyone who was so nice.

A deer tried climbing through the left window by slowly sliding its hands with long fingers and sharp claws into the frame. I grabbed a hammer and smacked its hands as it silently retreated. I rushed to haphazardly start boarding up openings. The boy was startled awake and I realized letting him sleep was a bad idea. I asked him for help but he hammered slowly and could only cover the bottom sections because he was short. After finishing, the same deer poked its rifle through gaps in the planks and fired a few shots at us so we hid behind the sofa.

I repeated the scenario and immediately got the boy to help me board everything up without gaps and no deer attacked because they couldn’t see or hear us.
