# Description

I was in a fictional first-person 2D horror video game as a female lab staff member who entered a hallway to confront a giant carnivorous plant swaying in an idle animation. Male colleagues urgently advised her over the radio to flee from the creature. However, she hesitated for a few seconds as it ruthlessly lunged at her without warning, causing everything to instantly fade to black.

# Interpretations

- Carnivorous Plant:
    - Don't linger near active threats.
    - Knowledge can be used for good to help others or for evil to cause harm and play god.
