# Description

After watching two men in a YouTube video build a pyramid in Minecraft, I decided to create my own with a hollow design that layered stairs facing outward. Those who entered had to complete 11 self-contained obstacle courses stacked vertically beneath the map that each consecutively teleported to the next upon completion.
