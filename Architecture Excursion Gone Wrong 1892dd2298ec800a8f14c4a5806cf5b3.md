# Description

I was part of an academic excursion, tasked with designing a new building for a client. During the initial site visit beside an elevated riverside promenade, we closely examined an intricate fish monument crafted from multiple layers of sheet metal. As we began conceptualizing a digital architectural model in thin air, it became apparent that our skills were inadequate to formulate a design suitable for public use. Venturing further downtown, we reached the client's headquarters within a skyscraper featuring externally exposed stairs.

Inside, we rode a windowless circular elevator to the prestigious ninth floor, where the client, bearing a resemblance to Alexander Armstrong, debriefed us on the project. He highlighted the pressing issue of diminishing urban population capacity, attributing it to the insufficient rate of construction for residential buildings. In response, I injected a touch of humour, noting that the city wasn’t exactly "future-proof." I followed up with a query about whether the issue stemmed from the transportation of supplies or their on-site assembly. While secluded in a side office, our attempts to devise suitable designs faltered as we grappled with a lack of skills to comprehend the entire design process.

We overheard other students inquiring about the location of their teaching supervisor, making us realize we were one level below. Entering the new room, we apologized for the oversight in arriving 15 minutes late and settled into our seats to reflect on theories discussed earlier in the year. However, only one individual could recall anything, leaving the rest frantically taking notes in hopes of maintaining direction later. A female art student, yearning to be expressive without boundaries, began crumbling under the pressure, exclaiming her inability to adhere to inflexible design principles. While she fled into the hallway, I assured her that there was nothing stopping her from creating an artistic display challenging public perception or applying cultural traditions in designs, so she returned overjoyed.

As everyone regrouped on another level before departure, the previously distressed student began losing her sanity again, evident in her scruffy hair. In response, a few other students started mocking her with subtle chicken noises, but upon noticing the client ascending the stairs from behind, I promptly instructed them to stop. While visibly dissatisfied with our lack of coordination and progress, the client kept composure as he instructed everyone to walk down all exterior flights of stairs to depart for the day, reserving the elevator for himself. I asked the client to let me use the elevator due to my fear of heights but he remained silent, reinforcing his earlier directive with only a stern look as the elevator doors closed and he descended.
