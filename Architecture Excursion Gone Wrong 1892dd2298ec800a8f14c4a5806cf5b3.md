# Description

I was one of many university students on an excursion to design a new building for Alexander Armstrong, the client. During the initial site visit beside an elevated riverside promenade, we examined a fish monument made from multiple layers of sheet metal. As we began conceptualizing a digital architectural model in thin air, it became apparent that we lacked the necessary skills. We travelled further downtown to the client's headquarters in a skyscraper with stairs spiralling down the exterior. We ascended a circular elevator to a fancy office on floor nine where we met the client who debriefed us on the project.

> **Client**: The city’s urban population capacity is diminishing because residential construction is lagging behind.
**Me**: Well the city isn’t exactly future proof.
**Me**: Does the issue stem from transporting or assembling supplies on-site?
**Client**: A bit of both.
**Client**: Please feel free to use my side office to work on the plans.
> 

We repeatedly failed to create a plan as we lacked skills and didn't understand the design process. We overheard other students in the hallway.

> **Other Students**: Where’s our teaching supervisor?
**Other Students**: I think they’re on floor 10.
> 

After realizing we were on the wrong floor we moved to the correct room and took a seat.

> **Me**: Sorry for arriving 15 minutes late.
**Teacher**: Before we start working with the client lets review the theory we learnt this year.
> 

However, only one individual could recall anything, leaving the rest frantically taking notes in hopes of maintaining direction later. A female student had a mental breakdown and walked towards the hallway.

> **Female Student**: I cannot adhere these rigid design rules!
**Me**: There’s nothing stopping you from creating an artistic display that challenges public perceptions or incorporates cultural traditions.
> 

When the time was up, everyone regrouped on another level to sit down on the floor. The previous student had another mental breakdown as indicated by her messy hair and others began mocking her as the client ascended the stairs and maintained his composure.

> **Students**: *Chicken noises*
**Me**: Stop the client is coming!
**Client**: I'm disappointed with your efforts today.
**Client**: I request that you all leave by walking down the exterior stairs.
> 

The client entered the circular elevator and faced us.

> **Me**: I'm afraid of heights.
**Me**: Do you think I could use the elevator with you?
**Client**: …
> 

The client stood with a stern expression as the elevator doors closed and he descended.
