# Description

I was walking along a street with a pedestrian island crossing when an angry man driving a red Ferrari crashed into a nearby fence and blamed me for making him lose control by merely being present. However, when I started writing his license plate number on my palm with a pen to make an insurance claim later he immediately got nervous. He tried to reverse and drive off to try stopping me from finishing but got stuck on something so I moved over to the right to complete it as he drove away.
