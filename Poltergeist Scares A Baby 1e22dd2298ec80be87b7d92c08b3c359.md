# Description

I was a poltergeist inside someone's home as two women discussed how some people aspire to become gods and abuse others in any way they desire like chewing on heads until their skulls break with an audible noise. Eventually, noticing their baby on the floor, I emerged from a TV, screaming as loud as possible to make it cry.
