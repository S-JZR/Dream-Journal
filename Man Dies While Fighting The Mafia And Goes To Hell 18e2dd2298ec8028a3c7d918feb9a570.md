# Description

I was spectating a man who was in debt to the mafia and stole a train to escape the country for a better life with his girlfriend. While driving along one of five straight tracks in a specialized train capable of performing speed boosts, the mafia got word of it and commanded nearby trains to form a blockade by parking on each track far ahead. However, the last train was running late and as it approached over the horizon there was a gap that led to a turning track that curved to the right of it so he accelerated at full speed. The front wheels sparked vigorously as they started to loosen so he sent her to fix it.

> **Man**: Climb out in front of the train and hold the wheels down until we can get out of here.
> 

After passing the other train she succumbed to severe burns and died. At the original train station the train driver spoke to police about the stolen train.

> **Train Driver**: I fear that if he is willing to do these terrible things then he will keep pushing the boundaries.
> 

Upon arriving at the next train station the train broke down, so he stealthily hijacked another one which he didn't realize was owned by the mafia and proceeded to travel somewhere else. Henchmen inside different carriages moved toward the locomotive to engage in a firefight but he hid beside the door and fired shots back to kill some of them but eventually died in the crossfire. The man woke up in hell and was greeted by Saxton Hale from Team Fortress 2.

> **Saxton Hale**: Welcome to hell!
> 

> **Saxton Hale**: If you've killed the most people in history then you can become the next ruler.
> 

Saxton Hale showcased all the portraits of people the man recently mistreated or killed with a levitating greyscale holographic oval and he felt guilty.

> **Saxton Hale**: Sorry you're a little short.
> 

Saxton Hale then created two portals with text and presented two options.

> **Saxton Hale**: Right I'll make you an offer.
> 

> **Saxton Hale**: You can either go back in time to change your ways or erase your memories to continue living in Hell without guilt.
> 

The man walked through the portal to go back in time.
