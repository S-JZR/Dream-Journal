# Description

A man in debt to the mafia sought to escape the country for a better life by stealing a train and was accompanied by one of his female companions. While driving along one of five straight tracks in a specialized train capable of performing speed boosts, the mafia got word of it and commanded nearby trains to form a blockade by parking on each track far ahead. However, the last train was running late and as it approached over the horizon there was a gap that led to a turning track that curved to the right of it so he accelerated at full speed.

The front wheels sparked vigorously as they started to loosen so the woman was sent to climb out of the cabin and hold them down. After passing the other train she succumbed to severe burns and died. Back at the initial station, the train driver speaking to a few individuals about the theft expressed his concern that if this marked the peak of his controversial decisions then nothing is stopping him from pursuing even more radical actions.

Upon arriving at the next train station the train broke down, so he stealthily hijacked another and proceeded to travel somewhere else. Goons inside different carriages moved toward the cabin to engage in a firefight but he hid beside the door and fired shots back to kill them but eventually died in the crossfire. After waking up in Hell he was greeted by Saxton Hale from Team Fortress 2, who joked that he could become the next ruler of Hell if he killed the most people in history. Saxton showcased a levitating greyscale holographic oval that transitioned between all the portraits of the recently killed people and remarked 'sorry you're a little short” which made the man feel guilty. Saxton then created two portals with text, offering him the choice to travel back in time to change his ways or erase those memories to continue living in Hell without guilt so the man chose the former to make things right.
