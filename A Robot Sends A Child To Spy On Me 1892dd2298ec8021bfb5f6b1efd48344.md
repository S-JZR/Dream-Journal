# Description

I was standing at the front flyscreen door of my unit when Ameca, a humanoid robot, was standing motionless on the footpath outside and starred at me with a subtle smile. The simple toggle lock transformed into a large green rotary dial overlaid with a smaller pink one in the centre. Both dials were divided into quarters by a red line and marked with alien symbols in the gap near the perimeter beside the finger indents. Locking the door involved aligning the correct green and pink indent at the top, causing the robot to walk away when releasing it couldn’t get in.

In the afternoon, a seemingly innocent young girl dressed in pink clothes with green pants approached the door, asking to come inside so I agreed to let her in. She wandered through the living room, laundry room, and backyard looking at everything. My dad seated on the sofa in the living room kept an eye on her. Eventually, I went upstairs to do something and upon returning downstairs she was gone. After asking my dad where she went, he explained that she fled into a car that pulled up outside on the sidewalk to pick her up. Immediately suspicious that she might have been scouting our possessions for a robbery, I decided to investigate the back of cupboards to see if she had bugged the house but found nothing.
