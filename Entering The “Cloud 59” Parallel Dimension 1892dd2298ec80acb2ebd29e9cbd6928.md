# Description

While inside my unit complex, the sound of my cat chasing something in the backyard prompted me to investigate out of concern. Down the stairs beside the water boiler, I witnessed a translucent white bearded dragon lizard without internal organs materializing. Upon re-entering the unit, I instinctively knew I was transported to a parallel dimension called "Cloud 59." In the lounge room, a tall white humanoid figure in black attire with red eyes and a plus symbol covering its forehead charged forward to attack me.
