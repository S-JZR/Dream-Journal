# Description

I was walking down the sidewalk near my unit complex when I encountered a grey tipper truck missing its front-left wheel and licence plate. Two police officers trailing behind me remarked that this was worth investigating as it seemed suspicious and warranted a welfare check to determine if the owner was struggling financially and unable to afford repairs. While ascending the hill, the officers followed me, and I felt nervous that onlooking neighbours in the street thought I was being pursued for doing something wrong, especially since they proceed into the unit complex. Eventually, they began knocking on different units to inquire about the incident, so I informed my parents to prepare in case they come over, but nothing occurred.
