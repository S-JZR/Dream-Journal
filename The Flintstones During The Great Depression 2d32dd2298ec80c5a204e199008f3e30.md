# Description

I was standing in a fast food restaurant watching a TV mounted on the ceiling playing a live action adaption of the Flintstones set during The Great Depression with muted colours. Everyone was wearing work clothes and Fred was wearing a bowler hat. Fred was discussing something with Barney in the wide outdoor entrance of a mine with concrete walls on both sides and spaced wooden planks on the ground. Various workers were leaving their shift which caused Fred to end the conversation and walk forward and left around a curve into a deep mining tunnel.
