# Description

My parents dropped my brother and I off at a sports club:

- left:
    - reception desk
    - prize counter
- right:
    - four player coin pusher
    - three storey structure reaching the roof, comprising an obstacle course and a basketball court on top, and surrounded by a mesh.

I swiped my arcade card on the coin pusher to start the session and inserted a few coins but I couldn’t stop because it kept giving me more coins. After walking away, different people briefly took turns playing but left prematurely without seeing the coins drop. They also didn’t swipe their cards so all the tickets earned went into my account.

The lights abruptly deactivated in the tall structure and everyone stopped moving for their own safety as a male announcer spoke.

> **Man**: Do you prefer electric or gas cars because electric car sales are going backwards?
> 

When it was time to leave I talked to my brother.

> **Me**: I should redeem a prize with all my tickets since we might never come back here again.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Personal Experiences:
    - My parents used to take me and my brother to the Carina Leagues Club and put us in the kid’s room when we were younger.
    - My parents used to take me and my brother to the Funhouse and Timezone when we were younger and sometimes we played modern coin pushers a lot like Fantastic Fever 3 and Medalink (Western Dream). The latter was easy to earn coins from.
- Radio:
    - References an ABC radio host asking an electric car question during my morning alarm.
