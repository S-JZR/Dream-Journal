# Description

I was in the hallway of a strange strict secondary school with students seated in classrooms on both sides. I fled out the front door to escape, which transitioned to the front of my unit. A trapdoor in the wall of the farthest unit opened and a robot on a monowheel started chasing me. I got into a car and drove through my neighbourhood as it followed close behind.
