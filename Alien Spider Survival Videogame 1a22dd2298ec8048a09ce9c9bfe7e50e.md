# Description

I was in a team-based survival game, defending against aliens until the timer ran out. Survivors were unarmed civilians who collaborated to gather weapons, equipment, and building materials. Dead survivors joined the enemy team indefinitely. Aliens were four-legged spider creatures with thick, hairy limbs that could climb walls.

Realizing survivors were constantly being overrun, I isolated myself to experiment with tactics. While hiding behind the enemy spawn in a forest, I tried clearing trees to get wood. However, as the last player remaining, I sprinted towards a four-story concrete building with the enemy in pursuit. Using a grappling hook, I quickly ascended the right entrance bridge, feigned entry, and leapt off. I swung between tall buildings, dodging aliens on the walls as they reached for me, securing victory as time ran out.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Swinging between buildings references Spiderman films I’ve watched.
- I used to play Team Fortress 2 a lot and it likely influenced the grappling hooks and zombie gamemode where players defend different positions.

## Symbols

- Alien spiders: the fear of spiders.

## Lessons

- If you follow the crowd then you will fail the same way they do.
