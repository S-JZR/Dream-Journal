# Description

I was one of many secondary students seated at a desk in a remote classroom when an Asian man with an accent entered the room:

- left:
    - door
    - windows
    - hill
    - black fence and a lake to the left
- front:
    - teacher’s desk
    - whiteboard
- right:
    - two doors
    - windows
    - dirt path with bamboo on both sides.

> **Teacher**: Hello everyone I will be your substitute teacher for the day.
> 

> **Students**: *Murmurs*
> 

> **Teacher**: To start, we’re going to have a math exam that I created to gauge your skill level.
> 

The man placed sheets of paper on everyone’s desk containing various bizarre questions with a few potential spelling mistakes but we weren’t sure and nobody could answer a single one. The students got rowdy and started mocking the teacher’s accent.

> **Students**: Why you want tu make us du da math?
> 

> **Students**: How tu du this?
> 

The teacher pulled out a black rifle and loaded it with a magazine.

> **Students**: *Gasp*
> 

> **Students**: He’s got a gun.
> 

A male student continued mocking his accent and the teacher pointed the rifle at his head and cocked it.

> **Male Student**: Sorry sir I’ll stop.
> 

I was concerned for my safety and when the teacher wasn’t looking I fled out the right side door down a dirt path. However, the teacher heard my footsteps and emerged in front of me from the other door and pointed the rifle at me. I immediately ran back into the classroom.

> **Teacher**: Why are you trying to leave my class early?
> 

> **Me**: Sorry, I’m going back!
> 

I looked out the right window and saw the teacher talking to a Latino woman on the dirt path while a male student standing beside him kept mocking his accent. The teacher got fed up and shot him in the head and he dropped dead.

I fled out the left side door up the hill and when halfway up I turned around to see the teacher gaining on me by power walking. The teacher held a stick with two hands as if he was about to choke me.

> **Me**: Mercy!
> 

The teacher lowered the stick.

> **Teacher**: Did you not hear my warning the first time?
> 

> **Teacher**: Follow me up the hill to the carpark and we can discuss what you’re concerned about.
> 

We moved to the carpark.

> **Teacher**: Ask me anything.
> 

> **Me**: What is the meaning of life?
> 

> **Teacher**: You know that is too complicated for …
> 

> **Me**: I can rephrase that.
> 

I unexpectedly felt emotional saying the last line and burst into tears.

> **Me**: How do you become resilient in life to deal with all the endless troubles that come your way?
