# Description

I was standing in the lounge room of my unit when a male news anchor presented breaking news on TV.

> **Anchor**: The hate speech laws recently released in Australia have led to severe unintended consequences as various people have been arrested across the country for posting their opinions on social media among other things.
> 

I was washing my hands in the laundry room when a policeman knocked on the front door and my mum let him inside to talk in the kitchen.

> **Policeman 1**: I’m placing you under arrest for recently watching Pauline Hanson’s A Super Progressive Movie.
> 

I overheard the conversation and walked into the kitchen.

> **Me**: Your joking.
> 

> **Policeman 1**: No.
> 

When the policeman wasn’t looking, I knocked him out and we hid his body somewhere in my unit.

Another policeman suspicious of his colleague’s disappearance knocked on the front door.

> **Policeman 2**: Excuse me, have you seen where my colleague went?
> 

> **Policeman 2**: I believe he came in here earlier.
> 

> **Me**: He went outside to the right to the loo.
> 

> **Policeman 2**: Why would he do that?
> 

> **Policeman 2**: That seems odd.
> 

> **Me**: Yes, it was quite odd.
> 

The policeman walked down the footpath to the front of my unit complex to look for him. I knew our time was short and turned around to my family.

> **Me**: We need to leave as soon as possible!
> 

> **Me**: Pack the most valuable things so we can go!
> 

I started making a new backup of the data on my computer via an external SSD to take with me but realized it would take about 20 minutes.

The same policeman returned to the front door.

> **Policeman 2**: Hello again.
> 

> **Policeman 2**: I wasn’t able to find him and I would like to come inside to check.
> 

I quickly exited the front door to knock him out and we hid his body somewhere inside my unit.

A red forensics vehicle later parked in front of my unit complex to search for the missing policemen. I fled to the neighbouring unit complex opposite ours and walked across the top of the wooden fence of the first unit as a dog barked at me from below. I considered falling left if I lost my balance to avoid being mauled. I climbed onto the red terracotta roof and moved to the other side. After waiting for a long time, I realized nobody was looking for me down the sidewalk and returned to my unit. The data backup finally finished so I took it and escaped with my family.
