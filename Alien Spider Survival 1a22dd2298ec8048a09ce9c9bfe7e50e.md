# Description

I was one of many survivors in a team-based survival videogame that involved defending against alien spiders until the timer ran out.

- Survivors gathered weapons, gear, and building materials. Dead survivors switched teams indefinitely.
- Alien spiders had four legs, thick hairy limbs, and could climb walls.

Realizing survivors were constantly being overrun, I isolated myself to experiment with tactics. While hiding behind the enemy spawn in a forest, I tried clearing trees to get wood. However, as the last player remaining, I sprinted towards a four-story concrete building with the enemy in pursuit. Using a grappling hook, I quickly ascended the right entrance bridge, feigned entry, and leapt off. I swung between tall buildings, dodging aliens on the walls as they reached for me, securing victory as time ran out.
