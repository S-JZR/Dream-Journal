# Description

I was one of many survivors in a team-based survival videogame that involved defending against alien spiders until the timer ran out.

- Survivors gathered weapons, gear, and building materials. Dead survivors switched teams indefinitely.
- Alien spiders had four legs, thick hairy limbs, and could climb walls.

Realizing survivors were constantly being overrun, I isolated myself to experiment with tactics. While hiding behind the enemy spawn in a forest, I tried clearing trees to get wood. However, as the last player remaining, I sprinted towards a four-story concrete building with the enemy in pursuit. Using a grappling hook, I quickly ascended the right entrance bridge, feigned entry, and leapt off. I swung between tall buildings, dodging aliens on the walls as they reached for me, securing victory as time ran out.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Swinging between buildings references Spiderman films I’ve watched.
- I used to play Team Fortress 2 a lot and it likely influenced the grappling hooks and zombie gamemode where players defend different positions.

## Symbols

- Alien spiders: the fear of spiders.

## Lessons

- If you follow the crowd then you will fail the same way they do.
