# Description

While outside my unit, I noticed one of my teenage neighbours, Mico, sitting silently on a tricycle. He looked exhausted with pale skin as he stared blankly at me. His mother tugged on a rope wrapped around the handle, attempting to provide him with some form of amusement as she slowly dragged him across the parking lot.
