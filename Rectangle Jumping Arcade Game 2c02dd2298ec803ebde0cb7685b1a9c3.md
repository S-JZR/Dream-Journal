# Description

I was one of a few people playing an outdoor arcade game as we each stood in separate lanes with distant tall rectangle tunnels that emitted a series of rectangles:

- Stepping on colourful rectangles increased your score.
- Stepping on grey rectangles ended the game so you had to jump over them. Different variants included:
    - Obvious bad rectangles.
    - Fake colourful rectangles that change at the last second.
    - Invisible rectangles with outlines.

Each score threshold offered higher prize tiers.
