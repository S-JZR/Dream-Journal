# Description

I was standing in the upstairs landing of my unit looking at my dad sleeping in the master bedroom. While descending into the lounge room, I found two clones of my dad resting parallel to each other on the couch and floor. Perplexed by this, I questioned how I could have more than one dad.

To investigate whether time and space differed between floors, I set the televisions in both rooms to the same channel. However, the broadcasts were identical, suggesting another cause behind the phenomenon.
