# Description

I was entering the elevator of a skyscraper to travel to a floor near the top but there was a window showing the city outside and I felt afraid as it rapidly ascended. I exited onto a slightly curved concrete skywalk with metal railings between two parts of the skyscraper as wind blew on my skin. I was afraid of looking over the edge and crawled flat on my belly to the other side.
