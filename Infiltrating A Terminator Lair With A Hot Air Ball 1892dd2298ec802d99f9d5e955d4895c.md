# Description

The world fell into an apocalypse because it was overrun by disguised robots and terminators.

I was standing in a hot air balloon travelling over suburbs at night with multiple fictional male teenage friends. We were looking out for robots when we noticed a seemingly normal radio tower and lamp post below extend legs and sprint to new positions. We discussed the scale of an AI war and the implications of mass-producing millions of autonomous war machines per hour.

Upon reaching the terminator lair, we encountered a man who had successfully reprogrammed one and armed it with dual minigun arms. The man planned a trade, posing as one of them, but reconsidered due to the heightened threat from the latest terminator model and the foolishness of trying to pass off authenticity where any detectable discrepancies would mean no chance of escape. Complicating matters further, the converted terminator's non-standard weaponry rendered it suspicious in this high-stakes encounter.
