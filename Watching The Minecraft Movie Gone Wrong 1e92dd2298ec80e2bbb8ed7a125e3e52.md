# Description

My brother and I were in the city near a cinema, so we decided to sneak into one of the auditoriums to try freely viewing the end parts or catch a glimpse of the Chicken Jockey trend. The room featured:

- Centre: two columns of tip-up seating.
- Perimeter: c-shaped seating with pine green tufted cushions.
- Wall: red bricks.

It was completely packed with diverse teenage and adult people, so we split up to find spare seats. My brother went right down the aisles, and I went left along the back row, repeatedly saying “excuse me” as I brushed past people’s legs while some pulled them back to make space. However, when sitting down between two groups of women, everyone to the right of me started moving out, and I realized the film had finished and was now showing behind the scenes footage of the cast discussing how the film was made. Another scene showed people dressed as Minecraft mobs in a room who played the roles instead of CGI, exiting through a door and going offscreen, and some viewers criticized the graphics as unrealistic. Eventually, everyone else started leaving, and I wasn't sure if my brother had left or not, so I checked the aisles and outside, but to no avail.

I entered a nearby building outside, connected to the complex, that was almost completely white, featuring:

- Front: wide staircase leading upstairs.
- Left:
    - Second storey narrow walkway with a glass balustrade
    - Slushy store to the left.
    - Hallway in the middle.

A couple walked along the walkway as the man complained of an upset stomach and vomited yellow liquid over the balustrade directly onto my head. It dripped down the back of my shirt and onto the floor. As he moved away into another area, still periodically vomiting, I stood back to yell at him, but they were so focused on their situation that they didn't notice me. I called out for a janitor, hoping to find one, but nobody came. While walking back to the previous building with the liquid still dripping off me, a stranger pointed me to a male janitor wearing a red uniform.

I asked if there was a shower here, but he said no, so I guided him to all the spots he needed to clean. During the journey, various scam website ads popped up on my phone's web browser and I told him I felt like I was under a curse today as various bad things keep happening and he chuckled. Once upstairs, he cleaned the trail on the walkway and found a longer one leading further down a hallway but we skipped it for now. We continued to the slushie store and were both horrified to find it completely filthy, with grime covering the walls and slushie ice scattered across the floor. A female attendant, behind a glass screen to the right, was casually filling tubs with slushie ice and placing them on a conveyor belt that led to a back storage room. She turned to look at me and I sternly told her that the store needs to shutdown for cleaning, effective immediately. She replied, “I understand”.

# Interpretations

## Influences

- Minecraft: reference to the Chicken Jockey trend [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie).
- Fred Claus: the messy slurpy store reminds me of Santa and Claude, the inspector, in Fred Claus who are shocked that the elves stopped working to dance, made a mess, and were told to get back to work.

## Symbols
