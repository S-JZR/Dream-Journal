# Description

I was waiting at the drop-off zone of my primary school for my mum to arrive on the last day of school while it rained. I considered buying something from the nearby gas station to celebrate but I didn’t have my wallet since I rarely brought money to school. I also thought about walking home but forgot to put my umbrella back in my bag yesterday. When I tried calling my mum she didn’t answer and I wasn't sure what to do next.
