# Description

I wandered through a city as screaming crowds fled from giants. The giants remained silent and never destroyed any buildings. A few soldiers directed everyone to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned building carved into a mountain. While many made it inside, a couple got crushed at the entrance. Some locals familiar with the street layout devised a plan to escape by digging a tunnel to an adjacent alleyway beside stores.

After hours of silence, we cautiously ventured outside into a sloped street. Noticing a pile of boxes and junk by the sidewalk, I shifted them aside to discover a hole leading into an antique shop. I discreetly hid artifacts in the boxes and planned to retrieve them at night. Later, I returned to the boxes, eager to claim the loot, but someone had already taken it. After stumbling upon a store with a sign that read, "Delivery drivers for hire!" a troubled woman inside explained that the giants scared away her employees, who took most of the delivery bikes, leaving no one to fulfil the orders. Despite recognizing the risk, I felt a sense of remorse and volunteered to help.

Embarking on the first delivery, I stealthily rushed between building walls to hide. However, my efforts were in vain, as a distant giant clothed in white steadily approached with booming footsteps. Overcome with fear, I pedalled as fast as possible toward a botanical garden on the city's outskirts. After following a footpath inside that crossed a pond with an L-shaped bridge, the giant couldn't see me through the dense vegetation and returned to the city. On the other side of the botanic gardens, I discovered a communal space in an open field where evacuees stood and sat among portable gazebos. My brother and Julien, a friend from school, were there, and we greeted each other. Julien's gaze shifted to the bike, pausing briefly before questioning its origin, prompting me to recall the story.

I parted ways with them and continued toward a fork in the path. I travelled down the right path concealed by overgrown shrubbery and encountered territorial plovers surrounding another lying atop a nest. I quickly turned back to avoid harm.
