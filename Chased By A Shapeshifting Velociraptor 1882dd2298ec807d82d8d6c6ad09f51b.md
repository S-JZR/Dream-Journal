# Description

I was standing at the front door of my unit when I overheard teenagers excitedly shouting in the low patch of land to the left of the footpath. Walking over to investigate, I saw them prodding a pear-coloured snake with a fallen tree branch. After briefly wriggling, it transformed into a velociraptor with a head reminiscent of Jerry Andrus’s dragon illusion and began chasing everyone. The teenagers scrambled up the mound of boulders and I fled to the entrance of my unit, slamming the flyscreen and wooden door shut. As I fumbled to insert and turn the keys, the doorknob rotated as the creature forced its head inside. I shoved it away with all my strength and secured the wooden door. The keys bent from applying excessive force, and another lock materialized on the opposite side of the door, offering additional security. Many hours later, during the night, a helicopter arrived, scanning the area with a spotlight as soldiers searched everything before leaving.
