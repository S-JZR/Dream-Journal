# Description

On a remote rural farm, a 24-year-old man was allowed by his father to live a privileged coddled life without needing to work. He was a pacifist who wore a white robe and was naïve about the world, behaving more like a child who was unconcerned about the future and pursued endless pleasures. His father wanting him to mature to get a job drove him into the city to start advertising his labour to others. For some reason, they decided to visit the royal palace first, perhaps at the son’s unrealistic initial request, to see if any jobs were available. However, after parking some distance away behind a large boulder on flat grassy land, a room on the top floor underwent multiple explosions from a terrorist attack as shattered glass from the windows flew outwards, prompting them to drive away in fear. A few years later the father tragically died and the son’s income gradually dwindled to nothing as he struggled to provide for himself. Julien, my friend from school, and I were sent to help prepare him for the world to become self-sufficient with a job. The son stood at a distance, onlooking his majestic house on a hill that was repossessed being demolished by construction workers operating excavators. While staying at my unit complex, we watched from the parking lot as people carelessly trampled insects covering the entire pavement. The teenager unsettled asked how anyone could do something so awful without a second thought. I explained how it reflected the real world. In the human world when people hate or view others as insignificant they see them as sub-humans unworthy of existing or are unconcerned with any harm caused to them. In the animal world stronger creatures dominate the weaker ones, devouring them to prolong their lives and grow stronger. We explained the purpose of a job was selling your skills to someone else who essentially rents you to fulfil a service. Two kinds of jobs include minimum wage performing low-skill repetitive tasks and specialised jobs that require training to perform advanced tasks. He became discouraged, realizing he had wasted his life without ever considering or trying to learn these things. I explained that if he wanted to change for the better, he needed to start acting like an adult by putting away childish things and persevering in work to achieve higher ambitions. If he didn’t know what that looked like he needed to find a role model to reflect on. In my year two classroom, we walked past a white landscape infographic taped to the window, showing the total casualties of World War Two. He asked what it was about but I told him that he wouldn't want to know because the tragedy was so great.

The disembodied voice of a narrator read through an illustrated children's book with a cool colour scheme that warned about how a nation could become tolerant of hate towards others. A wicked ruler demanded everyone to strictly adhere scientific studies he released, claiming that certain groups of people were a burden on society, depriving others of their resources. The public were outraged and formed mobs that searched the country to find and punish unfavoured groups, expecting everyone to join them or face the same consequences. Eventually on their journey, they transformed into purple silhouettes of tall grotesque figures with some details of worn-out overcoats and fangs. The same story played out in the world as I travelled through a town during winter as snow covered the ground. A few ordinary cheerful people standing around transformed to wear black fascist uniforms with grey arm bands and have stern expressions. Compassion and empathy were viewed as weaknesses while discipline and militarism were strengths to conquer threats and enforce their notion of truth. The Narrator explained that the people were conditioned to adopt a new mindset, becoming something they were once not, and were akin to vipers who sought prey to devour. Intrigued by a window covered in ice unlike the others, I peeked inside to see a male teenager frozen to death in complete darkness slumped back in an armchair in front of an inactive fireplace. The power to the household was cut since its inhabitants were enemies of the state and other family members scavenged for supplies while they stayed behind. In another house, a son destined for execution pointed a rifle at his parents who supported the state. Initially they were afraid of being threatened but when he lifted it to the back of his head about to commit suicide they became happy.

While seated on a thick concrete planter wall outside a shopping centre, I opened a book resembling the “Big Ideas” series by DK Books to a section larger than the rest, spanning 10 pages, with the icon of a person leading a crowd away with their singing on a grey background. It explained the dangers of seducing men who lure others astray into sin and false beliefs with pleasing rhetoric. A major warning sign of national group think is when everyone unquestionably adheres a specific set of ideas. An old man beside me overlooking the book explained that this is a significant problem in the modern world as people are unwilling to challenge their thinking and instead isolate into separate groups that affirm their beliefs. He explained how COVID-19 caused mass hysteria as society pushed conformity to the science out of fear.
