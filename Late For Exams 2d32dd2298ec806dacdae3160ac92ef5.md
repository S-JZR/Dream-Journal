# Description

I slept in until 2pm in my unit when my mum woke me up because I was late for my exams at 5:30pm on the last day of secondary school. I couldn’t be bothered checking my schedule so I didn’t know the order of classes. By the time I got ready it was 4pm and my mum asked if I wanted to be driven to the local shops to see if I could get something to eat for a late lunch and I affirmed.

At the fictional local shops with street markets we noticed a married couple and guests leaving a wedding banquet and lots of leftover food (e.g., rice and lamb pastries) in stainless steel trays were laid out on tables behind the front counter with heavily discounted price tags. I asked a female cashier if I was allowed to buy some and she said yes since the event was over and they were clearing everything out.

After eating, my parents drove me to my secondary school but the buildings and room codes were different and the complex was significantly larger.

I travelled to the right side of the school to a seating area above a cliff overlooking footpaths below. A series of spaced short solid log-rail fences on the cliff held back the dirt. I descended by grabbing the top of each fence with my hands. The top of the last fence was covered in ants so I shifted to the left to avoid killing any of them and jumped onto the footpath.

I travelled to the left side of the school to a classroom where Mrs Putin sat at her desk and students sat at desks with exam papers. The exam resembled a QCS test for English that involved writing a short story about an olive garden and magnet, and must incorporate a few literary devices. The front cover showed a Dalek travelling right along a footpath with a metal fence and an olive garden behind it.

I blanked out and worried about not coming up with anything good. I considered writing about a hungry man and his robot friend who travelled in the wilderness for days and encountered the olive garden so the man used a magnet attached to a lasso to pull plants closer to eat.
