# Description

I was seated in a car with three fictional male teenagers being driven along an elevated highway with buildings and snowy hills to the left. The teen in the left passenger seat wearing skis made an announcement. Man: I'm going to open the door and jump through the gap in the guardrails coming. announced he was going to open the door and jump through a gap in the guardrails to descend the slope below.

> **Man 1**: There is a gap in the guardrails coming up.
> 

> **Man 1**: I'm going to perform a sick trick by opening the door and jumping through the gap to ski down the slope.
> 

> **Man 2**: Go for it bro.
> 

> **Man 2**: We will watch you from up here and catch up to you later.
> 

He successfully jumped out of the car to land on the slope but when skiing to the bottom he launched off a mound of snow into the chimney of a recently inactive small incinerator building. The floor inside comprised a shallow metal grid filled with oil that was still boiling.

After deviating into a nearby carpark, we hurried down to the incinerator to find a way to reach him. We listened to the sound of his groaning through small rectangular vents and opened a metal door where we found him unconscious on a stone slab step with severe burns covering half of his body. We dragged him onto the snow outside and wrapped him in a wearable sleeping bag. He soon awoke and began wriggling around to try breaking free.

> **Me**: You were injured in a skiing accident and we're going to take you to the hospital.
> 

> **Me**: You need to stop moving and stay in the sleeping bag.
> 

He calmed down and remained idle.
