# Description

I was seated in a car with three fictional male teenagers being driven by one of them along an elevated highway with buildings and snowy hills to the left. The teen in the left passenger seat wearing skis announced he was going to open the door and jump through a gap in the guardrails to descend the slope below. We watched as he landed successfully but launched off a mound of snow at the bottom and landed in the chimney of a recently active small incinerator building with a grid of shallow boiling oil covering the floor.

After deviating into a nearby carpark, we hurried down to find a way to reach him by listening to the sound of his groaning through external small rectangular vents until opening a square door where we found him laying motionless on a stone slab step with severe burns covering half of his body. We dragged him onto the snow outside and wrapped him in a wearable sleeping bag. Soon he regained consciousness and began wriggling around, trying to escape. I reassured him that he was injured in a skiing accident and we were going to take him to a hospital so he needed to stay in the bag to remain stable as he calmed down and stopped moving.
