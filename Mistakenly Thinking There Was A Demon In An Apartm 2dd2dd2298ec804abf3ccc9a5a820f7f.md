# Description

I was standing in the pitch black hallway on the top floor of a hotel with a fictional friend and opened my apartment door to see the silhouette of a figure running past an open window letting in the sunlight. I tried activating the light switch but it was unresponsive and I became concerned there was a demon inside the room.

> **Me**: (Whispering) We need to leave immediately.
Me: (Whispering) Let’s exit down the stairwell.
> 

We entered the concrete stairwell and saw a man sleeping on a flat surface above the topmost railing. We quietly descended without disturbing him and exited to an outdoor area with two large pools on both sides of a footpath. We looked up at the my apartment window when movement caught my attention and the shot zoomed in on a boy flailing a teddy bear around and smiling. I realized everything was fine and there was no demon.
