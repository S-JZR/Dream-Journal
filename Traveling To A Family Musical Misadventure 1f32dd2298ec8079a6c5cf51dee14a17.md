# Description

I was standing in Gateway Baptist Church after the service finished when my mother explained that she had tickets for a family musical at another church later that day. Before leaving, I mischievously decided to amuse myself by attempting to startle those nearby using telekinesis to tidy up pamphlets on a table near the amphitheatre entrance, but the spectacle went unnoticed.

On the drive with my dad, there were only three teenage girls and me in the back seat, one of whom was Rhiannon from secondary school. We briefly drove to an unknown location for the girls to meet friends. Upon returning, they discussed childhood toys like Bratz dolls. I remained silent, imagining a scenario where the girls acknowledged me, to which I exclaimed, "So you do remember me!"

The hilly suburban roads gradually became steeper as we reached a road with a 45-degree angle. My dad abruptly stomped on the gas pedal, causing the engine to roar as the car rapidly ascended. Fearful of becoming airborne, we all shrieked as the car briefly lifted before crashing onto level ground.

Suddenly, my dad and I were involved in a criminal operation in a counterfeit ambulance. As a police car approached from the opposite side of the road, my dad instructed me to climb atop the roof and fix the paint job by applying a blue adhesive strip between the emergency lights. We parked in a shopping centre between concrete pillars and encountered two guards in orange vests talking to each other. I drew an MP7 and discharged an entire magazine, but they remained unscathed. We continued into the shopping centre and sat with a crowd in a two-storey amphitheatre adorned with gold patterns for the family musical.
