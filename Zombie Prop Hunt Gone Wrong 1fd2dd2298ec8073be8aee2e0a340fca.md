# Description

I was one of many players in a prop hunt videogame where the hunters were zombies that instantly infected players. The map featured a large rectangular spaceship hangar with one long side open to grassy mountains and the ocean, a rectangular two-storey sci-fi facility on the right, and a network of interconnected back hallways.

I was with a group of players who ascended to the second floor of the sci-fi facility, where almost everyone unanimously hid inside a holographic map table without collisions as cubes. However, everyone was eventually found and killed except one female player who launched onto the roof earlier using sticky bombs. The roof featured floating blocks to climb and she was caught too.

I followed the female player across a series of elevated indoor catwalks over water to a large gap leading to other distant pathways but she was hesitant to cross. As zombies sprinted from behind they caught her and I spontaneously put sticky bombs down in a panic to successfully launch across, forcing them to find another route. Eventually, I returned to the original building and ascended to the second floor balcony to climb across blue electrical conduits hanging from the ceiling to reach a tall circular podium but the zombies were close behind.
