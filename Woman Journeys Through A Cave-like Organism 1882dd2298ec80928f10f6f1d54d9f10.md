# Description

I was in a fictional 2D platformer video game as a female explorer travelled through a grey cave system that was also part of a giant organism. Eventually, she reached a T-junction where the passage curved upward and downward in a C-shape. The disembodied voice of a female narrator said something like she decided to travel towards the brain. As she ascended the path, everything slowly faded to white, prompting me to jolt awake in unease.
