# Post Dream

- I wasn’t certain whether the dream was real so I asked my mother to help me photocopy a scientific diagram of the rain cycle from our old collection of encyclopedias before school. However, when I showed it to Mrs Wardle she explained that the task was never assigned and I told her how the dream tricked me.
