# Post Dream

At the time were learning about the environment in class and I wasn’t sure whether the dream was real or not so I ask my mother before school to help me photocopy a scientific diagram of the rain cycle from our old collection of encyclopedias. However, when I showed it to Mrs Wardle, my teacher, she explained that the task was never assigned and I told her how the dream tricked me.
