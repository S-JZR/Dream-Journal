# Description

I was in The Conquerors 3 on a long island when I produced juggernauts and sent them to a shipyard to board a transport ship accompanied by a destroyer. However, the enemy dominated overseas and sent their navy to destroy ours while my team struggled to do anything.

With few options left, I built a shipyard on the island’s left side, prompting the enemy to concentrate there. I ordered a bunch of units who resembled a crowd of casually dressed people to swim across the ocean to a distant country. However, they were slow and the enemy navy noticed as they started moving back. Everyone on the team panicked about how we could get out of this situation without any of our units getting killed.
