# Description

I was a commander in an RTS videogame overseeing blue battle mechas arranged in rows of ten moving right along a dirt path to breach an alien fortress. They urgently requested support as they faced the imminent threat of being overrun by multitudes of light grey alien mechas approaching from afar. Various rocket barrages were launched in response to destroy the front troops, causing enough delays from pileups for allied troops to breach the sealed doors.

The next scene transitioned to an interior perspective, with Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil navigating on foot through the dimly lit facility with vines growing off walls. He kicked down wooden doors, checked around corners for zombies, and occasionally fired shots to try luring anything out with loud noises.
