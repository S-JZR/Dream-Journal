# Description

While immersed as a commander overseeing a military operation, densely packed blue mechas, arranged in rows of ten, were advancing along a dirt path to breach a fortified facility. They urgently requested support as they faced the imminent threat of being overrun by multitudes of light grey alien mechas approaching from afar. Various rocket barrages were launched in response to destroy the front troops, causing enough delays from pileups for allied troops to breach the sealed doors.

The next scene transitioned to an interior perspective, with Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil navigating on foot through the dimly lit facility with vines growing off walls. He kicked down wooden doors, checked around corners for zombies, and occasionally fired shots to try luring anything out with loud noises.
