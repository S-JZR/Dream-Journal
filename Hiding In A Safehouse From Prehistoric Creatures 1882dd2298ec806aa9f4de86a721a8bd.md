# Description

The world fell into an apocalypse because it was overrun by prehistoric creatures that attacked any light source.

I was standing in a safehouse connected to an underground carpark with other survivors as they discussed an escape route. I went downstairs to a door with a window leading to the carpark and peeled back newspapers covering it to shine a flashlight outside where I saw an Arthropleura twisting around ceiling pipes and a white velociraptor, resembling an animal seen through night vision. The velociraptor aggressively approached the door to peer inside and a black man behind me sprinted to put back the newspapers and warned me to refrain from looking outside again.
