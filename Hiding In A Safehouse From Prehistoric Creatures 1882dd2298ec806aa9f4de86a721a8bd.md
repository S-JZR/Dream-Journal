# Description

In an apocalyptic world various prehistoric creatures roamed around attacking those nearby or any illuminated object. Inside a safehouse connected to an underground parking lot, a team discussed an escape route to another location. Upon descending downstairs and peeling back the newspapers covering the door windows, I shone a flashlight outside. An Arthropleura twisted around ceiling pipes, while a white velociraptor, resembling an animal seen through night vision, aggressively approached to peer inside. Eventually, another individual put back the newspapers and instructed me to refrain from looking outside again.
