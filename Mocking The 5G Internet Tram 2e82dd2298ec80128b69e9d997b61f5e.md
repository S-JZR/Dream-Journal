# Description

I was following adults and children seated on a tram travelling slowly through a single-lane pedestrian-priority space resembling South Bank Grand Arbour at night:

- Left and right:
    - A pattern of 5m tall blue LED poles with curved tops followed by a pole topped with a translucent metal ball from the Steam sculptures in Brisbane City.

Speakers mounted to different poles emitted music promoting the new super fast 5G internet which I ignored and repeatedly interrupted with mocking lines:

> **Me**: Be spied on in real-time with the internet.
> 

> **Me**: Upload your mind to the internet.
> 

The children were surprised that I was being rebellious and kept looking back at me.

We teleported to the top floor of a multi-storey shopping mall and the tram turned into a small empty cart with two cushioned seats. The cart travelled along train tracks beside small stage sets of fancy British lounge rooms as a speaker built into the cart commented on each room which I ignored. Nobody wanted to ride it and everyone, including a group of Japanese tourists, followed behind. The cart turned very slowly around sharp corners.
