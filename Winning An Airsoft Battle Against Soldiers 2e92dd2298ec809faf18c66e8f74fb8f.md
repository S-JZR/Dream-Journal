# Description

I was walking through a rural airsoft area resembling a military base:

- left:
    - quonset hut barracks full of wooden creates and open side roller doors
- forward:
    - road
    - guard booth with a boom gate
- right:
    - field
    - miscellaneous buildings.

I approached the boom gate when a boy moved past it to explore what else was around.

> **Boy**: I wonder what is over there in the field.
> 

After an unexpected distant explosion in the field the boy abruptly returned.

> **Boy**: Let’s not mess with that.
> 

Various adults dressed as soldiers approached from the field and everyone was suddenly equipped with airsoft guns as they started fighting each other. The soldiers systematically moved through the area and tagged everyone they saw.

During the game, I stood prone behind a beam in a building beside the barracks and saw the head of a male soldier moving behind crates in the barracks. Eventually, four staff members obliviously exited the barracks in front of my building so I fired a few bad shots until tagging them as they had a look of surprise.

I was standing in a white cube office room with four other men, three sitting and one standing.

> **Man**: Since you’re a VIP member I’m going to give you 10,000 BBs that you can use.
> 

I thought it was great because now I could spit fire.
