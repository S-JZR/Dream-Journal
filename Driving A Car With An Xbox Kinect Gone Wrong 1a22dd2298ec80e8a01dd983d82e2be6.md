# Description

I was standing in a car without seats and drove it using an Xbox Kinect. The difficulty of grasping thin air led to unpredictable manoeuvres, causing the vehicle to frequently swerve onto the grass and gutters beside the road. People in other cars occasionally expressed concern by shouting, "What are you doing? Watch the road!”
