# Description

I was walking into a foyer dressed as a superhero about to do a live meet and greet with parents seated on the floor with their children in front of a stage waiting for me to arrive. One child approached me and presented a thin green foam mask he designed with a pencil face outline. I briefly transformed into Willem Dafoe from Spiderman and lifted the mask to my face.

> **Me**: This is a good attempt but the measurements need to accommodate the curves of the user’s face.
**Me**: If it stays flat like a stencil then it won’t fit properly.
