# Description

I was walking into a foyer dressed as a superhero about to do a live meet and greet with parents seated on the floor with their children in front of a stage waiting for me to arrive. One child approached me and presented a thin green foam mask he designed with a pencil face outline. I briefly transformed into Willem Dafoe from Spiderman, explaining how it was a good attempt but I gave constructive feedback by lifting it up to my face and showing that the measurements needed to accommodate the user’s facial curves rather than being static stencils.
