# Description

I was desperately looking for the bathroom on a cruise ship and descended an elevator onto a lower side deck resembling a beach:

- Back-left:
    - Pool.
- Back:
    - Circular tables with umbrellas and chairs.
    - Deck chairs.
- Centre:
    - Giant flat plasma screen TV spanning two-thirds of the area.
    - Hedges.
    - White picket fence.
- Floor:
    - Wooden deck.
    - Fake grass.
    - Moving metal mechanism.

The floor shifted me in a U-shape from the entrance to in front of the plasma screen. Eventually, after watching an interactive display of the Grand Prix where people could bet on cars live, the system inevitably malfunctioned, reverting to only showing non-interactive channels. A male guest tampered with the control panel box, switching it to a YouTube video discussing the top 10 things wrong with Hawaii. One of the points raised was about a fictional infamous busty online influencer who solicits strangers with her adult content, then suddenly flashed her nude photos onscreen. Everyone gasped in disgust, wondering why such explicit content was shown uncensored. Trying to fix the issue, I went to the electrical power switches behind the TV and randomly flicked one, illuminating the deck with string lights. Eventually, a staff member approached the front, investigating the issue by accessing the terminal and restarting the TV, asking if we had tried turning it on and off again, but it had no effect.

My phone vibrated in my pant pocket, and the prostitute from earlier began sending SMS requests to meet up for lewd behaviours. Despite declining, I decided to visit her anyway on a remote mangrove beside the coast to express my dissatisfaction. After discussing matters that left her annoyed, I eventually asked whether she followed biblical teachings, which strongly repulsed her. After a while of trying to get away, she kept following behind, unleashing a nonstop barrage of quick insults. Upon returning to the cruise ship with her tagging along, a passenger complained to the staff member that the prostitute intentionally shared explicit photographs on the TV. Consequently, the staff member discussed banning her from the cruise ship. Recognizing this as an inaccurate misrepresentation, I defended the prostitute by explaining that the images were shared by a third party, and she had no intention of doing it.
