# Description

I was walking in a wide red/brown brick sewer with a group of fictional friends trying to escape an evil witch wearing a purple dress and pointed hat who was chasing us. The tunnels had walkways on both sides and were cluttered with trash and cardboard boxes. The journey consisted of sprinting through a series of long tunnels, pausing in silence to check if we were safe, and fleeing again when her shadow appeared on a wall. We never clearly saw her as she was always at a distance. Eventually, we found a small storage room with cardboard boxes on metal shelves and travelled through a metal ventilation shaft to successfully escape to the surface.
