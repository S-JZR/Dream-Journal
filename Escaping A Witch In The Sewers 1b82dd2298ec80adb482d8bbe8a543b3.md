# Description

I was with a group of fictional people in an arched brick sewer with giant tunnels desperately trying to escape from an evil witch in purple clothing who was relentlessly pursuing us. The tunnels had a walkway on both sides and were cluttered with trash and cardboard boxes. We never clearly saw her, as she was always at a distance, only her long shadow cast onto the walls from illuminated areas.

The journey consisted of sprinting through a series of long tunnels, pausing in silence to check if we were safe, and fleeing again when her shadow appeared. Eventually, we found a small storage room with cardboard boxes on metal shelves and travelled through a metal ventilation shaft to successfully escape.
