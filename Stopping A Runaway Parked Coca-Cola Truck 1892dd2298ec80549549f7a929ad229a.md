# Description

I was walking down the sloped street outside my unit complex with a group of fictional friends, passing by a vacant Coca-Cola truck idling besides company-branded vending machines against the wall. One of them attempted to use a vending machine with glass fogged from condensation, but nothing occurred after inserting coins and pressing the button, leading us to believe it was either empty or broken. Suddenly, the truck began to accelerate, climbing atop the end machine where it halted abruptly. Eager to help, I climbed into the elevated driver cabin to pull the handbrake and deactivate the engine.
