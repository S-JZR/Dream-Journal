# Description

While travelling with my family on a long car trip to a honey factory, I noticed a tree outdoors and recalled a festival where a miniature cart ride carried people around. Upon returning home, we planned to go next year, this time opting for a faster train journey.

Onboard the passenger carriage, the room was nearly empty except for a dark blue carpet and a row of multi-purpose metal seats to one side that also served as toilets connected by a long pipe at the back. Upon reaching the destination, a festival was underway, so I partook in a looping cart ride that sharply arced over a tree before descending back to the ground.
