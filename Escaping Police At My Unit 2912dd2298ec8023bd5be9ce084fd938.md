# Description

I was in my unit when police started ramming my front door and I instinctively knew they wanted to arrest me. I didn't answer and climbed over the wooden fence in the backyard to escape. While on top of the fence, I saw a few police officers in the distance walking down the street to the left to reinforce the others. I climbed over the wooden fence belonging to the unit complex opposite ours and sprinted away.
