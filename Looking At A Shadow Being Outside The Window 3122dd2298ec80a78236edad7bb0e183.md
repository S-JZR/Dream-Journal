# Description

I was walking upstairs past the master bedroom in my unit when I saw my brother looking out the window so I approached him.

> **Me**: Why are you looking out the window?
> 

> **Brother**: I can see a strange shadow being in the distance.
> 

I looked out the window and saw the silhouette of a man standing to the right of a row of houses which turned around anti-clockwise twice, transitioning between a line facing sideways and 2D facing forward and backwards.
