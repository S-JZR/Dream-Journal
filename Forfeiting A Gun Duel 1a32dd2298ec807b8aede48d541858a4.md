# Description

While standing outside the empty garage of my unit complex engaged in a gun duel with a man inside, we wore bulletproof vests and could choose to use and upgrade different weapons. However, after they chose to focus on upgrading a sniper rifle to level 6, I decided to forfeit, not wanting to risk dying by it piercing through my vest.
