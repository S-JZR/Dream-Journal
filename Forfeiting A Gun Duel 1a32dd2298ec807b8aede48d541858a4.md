# Description

I was standing outside my empty garage engaged in a gun duel with a man inside. We both wore bulletproof vests, started with pistols, and could choose what equipment to unlock and upgrade over time. However, after they chose to focus on upgrading a sniper rifle to level six, I decided to forfeit, not wanting to risk dying by it piercing through my vest.
